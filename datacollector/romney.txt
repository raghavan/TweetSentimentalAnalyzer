  I don t know understand why  Romney  keeps saying that we are all under   the same God   are we really I know some who won t agree with him  

 I guess the main reason I don t like  Romney  is because I want  religion out of politics

 Candy held  Romney  in check  

 Was really hoping  Romney  would  break out in song  when asked to talk about who he really is  Maybe Beautiful by Christina Aguilera

 John Kerry  Mitt  Romney  keeps changing     You just can t trust this guy

  When his turn came on the  Libya question   why didn t  Romney  just say   Mr  President  answer the question   Who denied the add l protection    

 I think  Romney  DOES care about the  47%    he cares that they ve now heard his conversation  XD 

   Romney  loves to say he ran   balanced the  budget  of the  Olympics    Romney  got most of that $$ from the  federal govt    biggovtgettingthing

  My fat thumbs were determined to type Romeny  not  Romney   during that whole liveblog  They even did it just there     debate s 

  joerogan I think  Romney  is better because he s basically a used car salesman to me  

    Romney  labels  China  a    currency manipulator      I would not bite the hand that feeds you  Great policy

  Not unexpected  though  panel said they were torn between  Romney  and not voting  Undecideds  

  timothy_stanley   Don t you think that was  Romney  s weakest point in the  debate     Romney  should probably avoid all foreign policy to win  

   BretBaier Very surprised by the Hannity focus groups reactions  they were as adamant tonight that  Romney  won as they were last  debate   

 There is a big difference between living going thru something and having others tell u about it    Romney  has no clue   

   gretawire  Romney  won  he made his case  he is the next president of the USA  

  Romney  should be president  

 Mitt  Romney  could not put Candy Crowley in a  binder   Ha    debate    debate 2 

  Romney  just sounds so much nicer when he talks  

  Romney  lost bad 

  Romney  no where NEAR won the  debate   He couldn t even answer one question with a straight answer  

  If your voting because of race  remember that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican  and Mitt  Romney  s family Marched for  Civil Rights   

  CSPAN caller    I noticed how much of a flippity jibbit  Romney  was being    

  finneyk  Romney  had a female Lieutenant Gov and more  females  on staff than any other governor  Your argument doesn t hold water  Or truth  

   Romney  is terrible on stage  just like Senator Marco Rubio from Florida  

 Kanye West should ve came   interrupted  Romney  in the  debate   

 I don t know about equal pay  Romney   went through  binders  full of women as if  qualified women  are so hard to find   Romney  Wrong for women 

 Go  Romney   Lets get the  economy  going again and get people to spend money

   dwas_0305 their feet    Romney  being a   good man of God   should understand that   help those people too instead of try to take away things 

  Mitt  Romney  s lies are not the biggest problem  it is our inability to listen to his truth  

  joshtpm Candy did great too many times  Romney  get s away with lying to the nation about time he was called out with un disputable evidence 

  AndreaTantaros Wish  Romney  pursued those areas more vigorously  Candy s bias didn t help either  

  I ll be honest  the only tidbit I ve learned about either candidate is that  Romney  is a huge fan of The Killers  Now that s interesting  

    Very little of what governor  Romney  just said is true    themeofthe debate  

  Romney  stated government cannot create jobs then in the same sentence he promised to creat  12 million jobs    LMBO     Idiot

  Romney  rules end of storyy

      Romney  said NO  Taxcuts  4 Rich  just 4 middle class  Again  unlike what he s on the record saying he d do   20% tax cuts  4 All NOTpossible

   aravosis I think the  binders  comment reflects  Romney  s arrogance   self centeredness  if it was done  obviously he must have thought of it  

   Romney  competent  assured  informed  steady  

     blackenterprise  It s important to note  Romney  s answer on  immigration  tonight greatly differs from his answer during the primary  debate   

  Happy to live in a  Romney   free  country  although with his mentions of    North America   and the pipeline      frightening 

  So when I die  bury me next to 2 binders full of  women    Mitt   2 Chainz    Romney  

    what was Mitt  Romney  s big  gaffe  last night    showing up

  I wish someone had asked this last night  If the government cannot create  jobs   why does  Romney  think he can create 12 million   debate2012 

  Gramzy7  Romney  was so perfect on  pointing out these facts   

  A much better dig on  Romney  would be to point out that his response to  equal pay  was the gender equivalent to   Hey  I have black friends   

   Romney  do not know the  true meaning of   middle class      poor      struggle   etc  

 I think that  Romney  showed how he doesn t respect  normal  middle class  people  by just putting up his hand and talks about what he wants  

 It s national Ass day     I think Mit  Romney  needs to get his  contexts  right  

  On  women s issues    Romney  doesn t just talk the talk  he walks the walk  Just ask women who have worked for and with him  

  Reading highlights of the US presidential debate  it s apparent one should wear a helmet while reading  anything said  by  Romney    facepalm 

   FINALLEVEL When I watched  Romney   talk  last night all I could hear in my head was  MrChuckD singing   He talking loud  ain t saying nothing

  DebtTrut no problem      I think we both r disgusted with  Romney  s bominable  behavior   He is one mean guy who feels entitled to NO RULES  

  Mr    Romney     Mexicans    Latinos  should not be referred to as  illegals  They are people with have  families just like you   immigration 

 And he crushed the president on who would do a better job  handling our deficit   Voters chose  Romney  on the issue by a margin of 59% to 36%  

 Did  Romney  get those  Lady Binders  at Staples

  Romney  will magically become conservative and stop  supporting what he has  for decades if he wins   LoL

  DatB0iAlex  Romney  believes in god 

  Romney  has so many things to  brag about himself   I wish he was more comfortable doing it

   Salon_Politics  Romney  is 100% right   The mention of acts of terror  was a general  generic mention  It was not specific to Libya  

 Y all  They are saying this is a strong  debate  for  Romney   

 This debate wasn t as much of a blood bath as the last pres   Debate  but definitely a big victory for  Romney  

  I just don t understand how  Romney  s against  single parents  and also against  abortions   especially for those who ve been raped   logic 

  Romney  sealed the deal tonight Great Job

  jeremyjojola  Romney  needs to  respect  moderators a little more  

  Most disturbing comment by  Romney    that women in particular need   flexible work schedules     Must say  I am personally insulted  

 The only good thing about  Romney  is that  his sons are good looking   

   nytimes If Mitt  Romney  is elected  and he will be  100% of us will prosper because we will  have jobs       

  Yeah  Romney   BELIEVES  in God  but that doesn t matter if he doesn t  ACT  like it   dumbasses 

  Governor  Romney  had data  he just doesn t have the proper  solutions   

   Romney  is officially unqualified for the job  If you don t think so  please don t vote  

 Mitt  Romney  IS A JOKE 

 Mitt  Romney  says government doesn t  create jobs    why does he keep saying he ll create 12 million jobs

  Romney  s definition of  workplace equity for women  was letting them go home early enough to cook dinner  What an awful answer   

  lovelyAirikahxX exactly   Romney  would probably just  mess  it all up  

  What   Now  Romney  wants  women to get home from work sooner  so they can make dinner  Boys can learn to cook too  ya know  

 For the record  I do not believe  Romney  could have stopped  the attacks in Libya       vote

 It s nice that  Romney  wants to make sure  women in the work force  can get home in time to make dinner  

  billmaher  Romney  buried himself by  trampling the female moderator  while saying he cares about women  The dissonance was striking  

   Romney  wants to  kick off some shit with other countries   If he wins  get ready for another World War soon after 

  Jay_Severin  Romney  does well in the 2 on 1 format  

  Romney  said he sat cross the table from people who lost their jobs  That s because he  fired  them 

   FoxNews  Go  Romney   next time go into more about  Lybia     

 This is not the last word on  Benghazi    Romney  must revisit this in the third debate  

 I couldn t tell you what color  hair   Romney  has if you asked  Or if he even has hair
