  smp2004  Mitt Romney  If you think  Romney  won that  debate  you need your head checked out   Obama won in a rout  

 How embarrassing  Michelle Obama and Ann  Romney  wore the same dress    debate  

  justinbarbour I saw the last 15 and Obama seemed awesome  It was obvious  Romney  was flustered when caught out lying  

 I think  Romney  was the clear winner  Obama had more energy than 1st  debate  but his comments were the same old garbage  

   CNBC2012 Obama surrogates try to make  Romney  look bad   Nice try  not successful  

 It s gotta be ridiculously hard for Obama    Romney  to not cut each others throats on national television  

  We ll see what the  CNN polls say  but it couldn t be cleaner that Obama mopped the floor with Mitt  Romney  tonight  ObamaBiden2012 

 The biggest misperception I had about Mitt  Romney  is that he knows anything about people like me   MiddleClass  current2012  Obama 

  Whether you like  Romney  or not  he is loads better than Obama   stopwhining 

  It seems these commentators are against  Romney   and for Obama  Maybe not  Just seems like it  

 Obama saves his  47%  jab knowing  Romney  couldn t respond  A Mortal Kombat Scorpion  Finish Him  moment    debate  

 It was clear Obama was rehearsed to push  Romney  and that clock every second with that moderator lol 

 I wouldn t vote for either  Romney  or Obama but if I had to choose between the two of them I would definitely vote for Obama 

 Mitt  Romney  needs to drop out of the race and concede defeat to Obama 

    I believe Governor  Romney  is a good man   I believe that he said behind closed doors that  47%  of Americans are victims     President Obama 

  President Obama says     Your  pension  is MUCH BIGGER than mine   Romney   

  Obama  thank you for calling  Romney  out on all his lies  Great work tonight    debate   vote  rockthevote 

 Obama really needed to shut up tonight during this  debate   pissesmeoff   Romney 2012 

  Steve Schmidt makes great point   if Obama had done this in  first  debate    race would be over  But  Romney  still very much alive now  

 That was intense  Good to see Obama finally show up  He has more passion than  Romney  because he believes in  ALL of America    Debate2012 

 OBAMA WINS     Romney  sounded like a broken record   Romney  said the word  jobs  when the question was about cartoons  

    debate s  Romney  did Good even if hindered by 2  democrats   Crowly Obama 

  Obama did not shift the momentum back from  Romney    Thus  it s a  Romney  win tonight   fb   debate  

  I m for Obama and the democratic party but let s just say if  Romney  was black   would y all still hate him  

   Romney  wasn t bad in Truth  But Obama Acquitted himself Nicely   stepped his game UP 

 Obama >>>>  Romney   

  My questions for  Romney  will never be answered  I feel   But on a positive note  Obama went out with a bang    Forward2012 

  RyanSeacrest Obama   Romney  was just spewing lies   

 At the end of that  debate  Obama is still a dumbass  And  Romney  is still stuck in one state  

 Wow Obama    Just wow  I pray to god that  Romney  gets in office  I don t know if America will last another 4 years with Obama    

 Ways to make better  Romney  Obama  debate s  First one who can accurately explain the infield fly rule wins  

 Post  debate   people of color vying for Obama s attention  Fewer people around  Romney     debate  

   RyanSeacrest Obama won   Romney  has some good ideas  justNeeds to be in the other party  

 Just vote for Barack Obama because this time he has the red tie and  Romney  s blue tie made him look feminine and indecisive   debate  

  Wait  they think it was a narrow win for Obama  Seriously   I d say 70 30 Obama  easy   Romney  can kick rocks with his  47%   

   chrisrockoz   debate s DUH  Romney  isn t running for president of Mexicans  or dogs  Poor   blacks WAY worse under Obama fact check it out 

  Obama got more time  but we all gained more from  Romney    qualityoverquantity   debate  

 i watched the  debate  without logging on twitter   I think  Romney  did very well   Romney  still credible   Obama has ZERO 2nd Term agenda  

   Romney  supporters think  Obama supporters are ignorant  Then again all  republicans  think everyone is ignorant 

  Romney  missed several opportunities to expose Obama as the Marxist liar he really is 

  I m just watching the  debate  now  Obama is destroying  Romney  in the Libya part  

  Here we go     Obama was angry   Romney  was much more pleasant     CNN did I call this last week or what  prophetik 

 Obama doesn t even have a eligable opponent  Romney  is incompitent  

  riiiiiight RT  realDonaldTrump  Obama better than last time  but again   Mitt Romney  wins  Good night    debate  

  Romney  caught on the  Libya  thing    Obama did say it was terrorism next day    but public kept talking about the video    Crowley is right  

   Romney  alienated women  self immolated on  Benghazi   squabbled   squirmed   Obama reminded us why he s president   should be again  

 This  Saltine on  CNN just said Mitt  Romney  was more pleasant than President Obama and this other  Saltine said President Obama has no plan  

  Lmao I d love to see that    DaneCook  When do Obama    Romney  head outside to compete on the Wipeout obstacle course    debate    

  U say u wont vote  Romney  cause he is mormon thats like me saying no Obama cause he is black race religion have nothing to do with it    wtf 

  Also  Obama didn t end the  war  in  Iraq   Like  that just happened when he was president  That doesn t mean he did it    Romney  

 I had to turn from CNN    Draw  Obama had daggers in his eyes   Romney  was pleasant  Idiots  All of em   PresDebate2012 

 Lol   people who say  Romney  is only for the rich  If you watched the  debate  you would know that it s just obama s advertisement 

  When  Romney  was strive he was right  when Obama and Biden did it out was wrong   I see a pattern  

  Romney  had a script for the 1st  Debate     Obama didn t     Romney  s facts in the 1st  debate  were inaccurate  

  Romney  was ripped off by the moderator lying to cover Obama on  Libya  

 Why do people always say  Romney  crushes Obama in the  debate s  Just because he sounds confident doesn t mean he has good content  

 Guess why  Romney  cant overturn Roe vs Wade  Because of the fair minded supreme court justices this administration has appointed   Obama 

  That  debate  was all Obama and  Romney  looks like a   sketch deal   salesman    Romney  manipulated facts  got big pieces wrong  dodged  

  maddow  Obama won the  debate    Romney  was rattled early  Great job Mr  President  

 I just really hate  Romney   Stop slandering Obama and beating around the damn bush  Just speak your peace and focus on your platform  

 I Guarantee All Blks Vote For Obama And All Whts Vote For  Romney    

 Pres  Obama performed much better today than he did in the previous  debate   Candy Croly fact checked  Romney  on the Libya question   Debates  

  PMT debate  Obama has done his homework  Really sharp today n hiting hard  callin  Romney   liar  offensive no   47%   itsmainakageni  Teamobama 

  Romney  spent the ENTIRE  debate  talking about what Obama hasn t done  

   toddschnitt  Romney  2   Obama 0    Obama can only say  It wasn t my fault  Nothing he says are facts at all  He is the one that lies   

   Romney  doesn t exactly grab the  middle low class  votes by repeating what Obama said   Obama put  Romney  on blast with that   Me Too   bit  

  The analyst say  Romney  won on economy  Obama won on  Middle class  solutions  I think Obama won hands down  

  Obama cares about the  college kids    immigrants   and everybody else  Mitt  Romney  cares about the $$$$$$$ 

  jordangauger Making money is huge     Romney  has created more jobs in his companies than obama has in his 4 years as pres 

  My take on  debate   Obama did better than last  debate   but not good enough   Romney  held his own  Both had hits   misses  but  Romney  won  

 I know  Romney  is going to somehow bring up the  47%  issue in the last  debate   He s not going to let Obama get the absolute last word  

   NBCNews  Oil production  on Federal land   Is Up    Romney   Again  Obama was right  nbcpolitics 

  Obama  2013    Poor   Romney  just can t seem to get his facts straight    lmfao 

  That  debate  got heated   Romney  almost brought the Chicago out of Obama  I bet he has a cigarette when he gets out of there   Romney   a xanax  

  So people are mad because Obama didn t mention anything about God like  Romney  did  I was confused  I thought this was a  debate  not church  

  As a  woman   I truly do not understand how other self respecting women would vote for  Romney    BarackObama has my vote 100%  Obama2012 

 Obama never answered a question   why is that    Romney  told us his  plans    we didn t need to hear it again from Obama   answer the questions 

  Just give  Romney  and Obama some boxing gloves  and let them battle it out   PDSLive 

 I felt like neither told us what they WILL do   Romney  attacking what Obama has done  Obama defending what he has done  

 Obama won the  debate  with 37% vote compared to  Romney  with 30% 

  FourMoreYears To turn what BUSH made a big mess  You dont see  Romney  talk about what BUSH did to the country  Let Obama change it back    

  donnabrazile best line and best point was Obama telling  Romney  he wouldn t invest if he wad told investments economic specifics 

   Romney  was exposed tonight  There is very little the President could have done better with   Romney  played the bully  Obama played the hero  

 Do people even know why they re gonna vote for Obama instead of  Romney   

  Smart that Obama s campaign team took  Romney  s trending   100% of Americans   quote and sponsored it   boom

 I still believe Obama did bad the 1st  debate  purposely    To have better knowledge   feeling on  Romney     _ 

  In the  CBSNews Instant Poll  65% say  Romney  won on the issue of the economy  34% say Obama won on the economy   ² 

   Obama is a responsible President and has kept sound principles   Going against   China  on currency issues is wrong  Mr   Romney     cspan2012 

  pwanyonyi  Obama tried to put a straight face  perhaps to scare   Romney  from his constant interference 

 THIS RT  collegepolitico  Romney  won but Obama did enough to let the liberal media write the comeback narrative they wanted to

    I was all for  Romney  after  debate  1  now I m for Obama  Guess my vote ll be decided by the 3rd  debate     said nobody at all

 I bet  Obama  has a   binderfullofwomen   Romney  certainly isnt the only one to have one

   Mitt Romney  should remind  Obama  that    taking responsibility    is not an empty noble gesture 

   Romney  was correct when he talked about the  oil drilling  and when  Obama  said   governor that s just not true   HE WAS LYING 

  If u knew anything about how this country was built and founded  youd realize  Obama  and  Romney   ruin this country   voteRONPAUL 

 I think it s very ignorant of people to think  Obama  can just  fix things  in 4years Oh and  Romney  can just snap his finger and things are done 

 Maybe  Obama  represents good and  Romney  represents evil  And maybe the winner next month determines the fate of the world as we know it

 I m voting for  Romney  mainly on one thing    his  faith  in GOD    Obama  didn t talk about his faith bc he can t bring up Allah to Americans   

   Obama  LOSES  No answers just more rhetoric    Romney  owned it  

 I noticed some republicans are against  Romney  s  policies  while ALL democrats are with  Obama  100%  

 I don t care who wins they both suck  Romney  is an idiot and  Obama  has been in office 4 years an the only change has been more unemployment 

  For 2 hours  Gov   Romney  briefly  answered questions   Then   attacked  Pres   Obama   Lack of civility between the 2 but Pres  won this debate  

 Seems to be a bigger crowd around  Obama  than  Romney    debate2012 

  Its not fair that  Romney  just  attacks   Obama  s failures  at least he has the decency to  admit   apologize  for making mistakes 

   Obama  actually has a plan to move us forward  with  Romney  we would be stuck cause his only plan is the get rid of  Obama   

  Lightskin_Pinky I have my reasons to like  Obama      I don t believe in the things  Romney  is trying to do

  EvaLongoria I disagree    Romney  stood his ground and used  facts and numbers    Obama  used pure rhetoric and couldn t  defend  his record 

  Romney  only  cares  about rich white people    Obama  cares about everyone surely the debate should be irrelevant even on these terms   baffled 

  Obama  has a lot of  commercials      Romney  has a lot of  lies      

  AaliLadak most of America will believe it was pretty even   Romney  definite wins in  economy and jobs  but  Obama  wins in the  environment  and

 President  Obama  took on the bully  I substance  demeanor  and debate style he was far more effective than Mr   Romney   No doubt a good night  

  Obama  won  the whole thing  but especially the last question   debate 

 Once again  Obama spoke longer than Romney  but Romney  used more words than  Obama  

  Obama   doubles down on his cover up   I love it  

  Obama really stood up for Latin people  Hispanic and children of illegal aliens    Mitt  made it clear you got to go  

  Obama  better than last time  but again    MittRomney  wins  Good night   debate

  Obama  would be more convincing if he weren t the incumbent  He keeps talking like he just started last month  

  Obama  says   I m gonna do this this and this   but why hasn t he done it yet  What happened to doing that these past 4 years   stepup  Debates 

 My take on  Obama  tonight    There is  nothing worse than aggressive stupidity      von Goethe 

 Big  Angry Obama  just came off as  unnatural  uneasy and uncomfortable   I think it made him look sour and mean   debates 

 So just to be clear     Obama  loves Planned Parenthood    Romney  loves families   Just to be clear  

 Listening to tonight s contraception exchange  I think Obama  understands my patients  needs better than  Romney    debatehealth 

 Maybe I missed it  but did President Obama  go another full debate without outlining his plan for next four years   debate 

 President  Obama  100%   Very  very obvious     Binders of women      I don t think so  

 We re a little off topic  here     Obama  when he got caught with Chinese investments  

 So the government doesn t create jobs  but it s  Obama  s  fault  for not creating jobs  

 If you can not beat them  then  lie  lie lie to the American people and hope they are to stupid to fact check and care    Obama  

 Me voting for  Obama  would be like me running my head into a wall  over and over and over and over  

 I find it revealing few people even comment on  much less get troubled by   Obama  talking about    hunting people down    like he s a T 1000 

 I really would like to tweet my opinion on the debate tonight but I don t think I could fit it into 140 characters how ridiculous  Obama  is  

  Obama  is an idiot     and that s all I have to say about that   Votefor Romney 2012 

 If  Obama  is here    who s running hell   SHFL 

  Obama killed it tonight  Absolutely killed it  If i believed any of it I would vote for him  But such an improvement  

 _ President Obama  is  controlling this debate completely   This is remarkable to be seeing this   nbcpolitics  History _ 

  Obama  s eyes back up the meaning of what he says   Romney  s eyes betray him at every word  

  Obama promised so much last time and didn t do anything so Im confused as to why everyone believes him this time  

  Obama  put more border patrol agents on border     then gave Mexican drug cartels guns to shoot them with  

  Obama  is what we need for a  steady  permanent improvement in our country   Y all already know who I ll be voting for   fuckmitt  Obama2012 

  Obama  has had 4 YEARS and all he has done is drive our country into a hole  Look at the shape America is in  What else do you need    Romney  

 What  Romney  and everyone else needs to realize is that  Obama  is just one person  He can t fix 8 years of damage by himself  

 Let s be clear   Obama is no  great friend to immigrants and brown people  around the world   debate 

 Our  economy has raised 17% in the last four years   Obama  made something out of nothing 

 I truthfully can t stand listening to  Obama    He hasn t done anything to get us out of debt so why the heck  would you vote for him 

  Obama  got more  immigrants out of here  than any other president  

 If  Obama were an ice cream flavor  it would probably taste like bad decisions __ 

 My mom was a single mom  Obama  that doesn t make you a female in the workplace 

 Eeeewwww  Obama  s fingers are so long    

 I think  Obama  has a blinking problem   presidentialdebate2012 

  Obama  is by far the better choice  I honestly believe both of them aren t all that great but we re better off with Obama  

  Obama  s administration deported more illegal immigrants than any other administration before him  What is  Romney  talking about  

  Obama  should pay attention   Had to ask name again   Really  

  Obama stop taking bin ladins credit  The cia and bush admin has been working on it for years and all you do is say   shoot him    FoxNews 

 Yes  Obama  you have done everything that you can   WHICH HAS BEEN NOTHING    

  Obama  is LITERALLY choking   

  Obama  deported my grandma 

  Obama  had to attack  Mitt  because he doesn t have a record to run on  He s not pro the American dream  he was part of the communist party   

 Never thought I d say this but I really hope  Obama  gets reelected 

 I m a firm believer of Obama  s slogan  We need to CHANGE the current president  

 Q  How can Obama  improve the economy  A  Lose the election  

  Obama  dropped the ball on the Benghazi attack  Fact 

  Obama   did awesome tonight   I live my president  Great job   obamabiden2012 four more years  ___

  Obama   I applaud u sir  U never backed down  U were on point and defiant   Romney  didnt phase u  u phased him Great job Mr President   Debate 

  Obama  was certainly more awake and combative this time around  but not really any new ground covered  Also  Romney  lied  like  a lot  

 I salute  Obama  he don t just care the rich folks   he support the poor as well   unlike Romney  

  Obama  s closing was far better than  Romney  s   debate  Debate2012  CNNDebate 

 President  Obama  brought it home   fourmoreyears 

  Obama  really wants us to have an education    

 I like how  Obama  did exactly what  Romney  said he does  concentrate on bashing Romney and not tell about his actual policies  

  Obama  won this one on style  substance  facts and character  

 This is My President  Mr  President  Obama   This is the man that has done all he can to get this country back on track  Let s give him 4 more 

  Obama  you had four years and shit has not changed like it was said to  So therefor you don t deserve another four  

 This time I was much more impressed with Obama  s performance  And Romney  just supported my opinion that he s wrong for America in this era  

  Obama   notice how Romney  actually ANSWERS the questions  You should try that      yourstoriesareirrelevant  quitrepeatingyourself 

  Obama  Cant run on his record due to the fact of  all the failures  

 Wow    Is Everyone really going to be fooled by  Obama  again   What good has he done for us in the last 4 years   

 Meanwhile  Obama sounded very confident telling a bunch of  bald faced lies    debate 

 I love how Obama  tried to get the subject changed after  Romney  pointed out that Obama called Libya a terror attack the next day  Haha  Liar  

 When Obama   didn t say anything about God   that really bothered me    

 SherriEShepherd loved that President Obama  ended with the 47% comment  Very effective  

 first  Obama   I hate to tell you this  but you had nothing to do with killing Osama Bin Laden  

  Obama  takes way to much credit for killing Osama Bin Laden  I m pretty sure that was the navy seals  

 Not even close  A complete reversal from the first debate   Obama  winning on every level   Audience connection  emotional appeals  facts   

 Did  Obama  even do anything his last term that actually benefited America sufficiently  

 Huge performance from  Obama  tonight  a clear victory     Romney  was agitated and unpresidential   TeamBarack

 That look  Romney  gives when looking at  Obama  it s like he s got hearts on his eyes  MyThoughts  debate 

 The major difference in this debate   Obama  is elaborating on  his plans   whether they are put into action in the future or not 

  Obama  wants us to  create  the next Apple  Like  A pear I figure  

 From shovel ready to high wage high skill  You couldn t do shovel ready  Obama   how are YOU gonna go high wage high skill   lnyhbt  Debate

 I said it last week  To win   Obama  had to attack   Romney  s personality and ethics  and expound on his plans for the future   GoodJob 

 Candy  some  jobs  aren t going to come back       Obama   Debate2  it s bc the  wages  are too low for American ppl  High Wages is our goal

 I m  proud  to call  Obama  my president   Obama 2012 

  Monte_na I honestly think  Obama  will win tho 

 I still laugh at the fact that  Obama  referred to a   child   as a 21 year old the last  debate   

 I praise  Obama  4admitting some  jobs  can t b brought 2 US   Romney  is off his rocker if he thinks we can compete w overseas  iphone production   

 President  Obama  HAS my  VOTE   Romney  is SO damn lost cnt imagine him running this  country     

 Set the  people  straight  Obama   

  Obama  claims    low skill   jobs  belong overseas  _shows his real lack of concern as it regards having ALL Americans being able to  WORK  

  Obama  should say I want  world peace  and drop the mic  

  jaronjones That exchange was a complete embarrassment for  Obama    He had nothing to say in his defense  

  Obama  literally just said some jobs aren t coming back and that he doesn t want  low skill jobs   High skilled industry can t  employ  everyone  

  tjholmes That  case  can t be made   Obama  60  Romney  35  and gotta give Candy a High Five  she was subperb  

  Obama  better make these  2 minutes count  

  Obama    When I was president      Anyone else caught that  Lmfao  

  Jobs  are not the answer  WOW mr  Obama  

   Free enterprise systems      Obama  

  Obama  vs  Romney  reminds me of  therock vs john cena     

  Romney  just said all the  campaigns  just attack him but that s definitely what he did to  Obama   No one s falling for your  deception   

  debates  Obama  believes our  tax  $ is his to give to his highest contributors  

  current i think  Romney  is going to ruin our  country  if he wins   Team Obama  

  Obama    Self reliance   but you didn t build that  

  debate      Obama  just murdered   Romney  s selling point    STRATEGIC A F 

 Now  Obama  comes with the big lie   He believes in  risk taking    self reliance   etc   Oh come on   First time I ve heard him say it  

  Talkmaster  Heck  after tonight  Obama  may  vote  for  Romney   

 Gees   Obama  LOVES  free enterprise system   Who would have thought

 I m telling you  Obama  is  illuminate  

 Mitt gets 2 minutes and  Obama  gets at least 4    Cheater 

 cannot believe  Obama  just brought up the  47%  thing  

 Given how many people think  Obama  is a communist socialist  him saying that the   free market  is great IS countering a misconception  

 So awkward seeing Duran argue with James about  Obama  on fb right now   LOL 

    Obama   just said he believes in  self reliance   That s 100% against all of his  policies   He wants people to rely on the  government

 FINAL  SCORE    Obama  1   Romney  1   debate  debate2012 

 Is it possible to believe in  capitalism  while bring a socialist  That s what   Obama  just said he wants us to believe   debates 

  Obama   

 Amennnnn         Obama  

 President  Obama  you  got my vote   debates 

 No doubt that  Obama  talks a better game  But the  both suck  The whole  system  sucks  Can I vote for a  new government   

 I m I the only one that sees similarities between  Obama  and  TheRock   

 This final  Obama  hit on the  47 percent comment  is his best punch so far  Strong finish for  Obama    debates 

 Go on  Obama  slug them down  Barack Obama  he knows what its all about  Romney  is a tool and can t spell matt  mitt lol 

 Awesome  closing remarks  for Pres   Obama  

  TheLastWord  Barack Obama   I wish President  Obama  would have brought up the fact that the Republicans want to get rid of  minimum wage   

 You just had to know that  Obama  would close with a  47% jab   

  Obama   talks  so slow    

   Time   Romney  40 40 to  Obama  44 04  more differential than the full time of one question   Not impressed    debates 

  Obama  jus shut him down     

  Obama  passed up so many   job offers  that could have made him as rich or richer then  Romney   But he cared bout the  country  and went for prez 

 FINALLY   Obama  calls  Romney  out on his  47% comment  that denigrates  honest  diligent people    thankyou  debate 

  Obama  is a nice person  

 Both sides will claim  victory     Obama  did better than  Romney  though    

 I m all for  Obama   That s all i m saying about this political crap  

  Obama  WON             Yay     Team Obama  

  Obama  just uppercutted  Romney  like the bus driver did that girl with that 47% finish  

  eddiegossage think  Obama  won on the  closing statement  alone  

 for people who prefer the  sports analogies     Obama  was sitting on the  47% fastball   

  Obama    Romney  hates  veterans   vote for me   ComeOnMan STOP 

  JamesTHarris Can t stand to hear  Obama  s voice anymore  Lies lies lies     

  Obama  definitely brought his  A game tonight   Good job  Mr  president  

  Obama  came out guns blazing  I believe he won this  debate   

 At least  Romney  admitted his  faith  and  Obama  didn t go near it   debates 

 Absolutely    RT  foreveryagirl I think   Obama  did a much better job in this  debate  vs the last one   Obama 2012 

  Debate  was good until  Obama  and  Romney  stopped getting in each others  faces   debates 

   Obama  saves the best for last  Brings up  47% remark  at the end of the  debate   Last thing everyone hears  He slams  MittTheTwit   debate2012 

 Yeah  Obama  never called it a terrorist attack in the rose garden  Called it an   attack   that s pretty broad Barack 

 I love the love the  Obama  s  show  for each other _  « 

 Mitt  Romney  just tries to answer   questions  by attacking  Obama    having wrong  facts    ohokay 

 I really though  Obama  and Mitt was gonna beef son 

 Yes  first lady Michelle  Obama  is always  on point

  billmaher  Obama  murderer  Romney   

  Close debate   but I think  Obama  took it  

  Romney  dismantled  Obama   Simple as that    Romney 2012 

 This was a great  debate   Good job  Obama   

  Romney  crushes  Obama  again    debates    I m done  

 Now that s the assertiveness I  want to see  from President  Obama   

 President   Obama  was better  he was more specific  confident  MSNBC it might be easily considered  Obama  s best  debate  performance  

 Hempstead brought out the aggression in  Obama  

  Obama  isn t that great but he s def better then Mitt here lol 

 Clear  victory  for President  Obama  

 Number one reason I hate  Obama   Because  killing  a child should never be legal  even if you consider it just a  group of cells   

  DakodawithaD  Man  I m amazed how much of a liar  fake and moron  Obama  is  He has really  outdone himself    debates    Romney ftw 

  Romney   you were pwned  team Obama  

 Clear  victory  for Pres  Obama  to this debate     _ _ _ __ 

  Obama  went for the kill tonight 

  Obama  calls  Romney  a liar throughout both  debates   yet finishes the  debate  with    Romney  is a great man    Fake 

  RI4A Very clear that  Obama  will persuade an  Inmigration  support   Romney  won t support any  inmigration  plataform in benefits of inmigrants  

 To me who won the  debate  is   Obama  yall already know don t care what nobody say 

 You did it  Obama   You beat that disrespectful piece of garbage called Mitt  Romney   C mon  Obama   let s get that  4 More Years   Debates 

 Wow   Obama  did  phenomenally   

 its funny because my entire family is like super republican and im just like    ehh   Romney  s ok   Obama  s ok  I don t actually care    

  Obama  did lie about the  Arizona immigration model  success reference though  

 Bring jobs back   O   Obama  

  Obama  was a force of nature on this  debate  

 One   mistake  compared to 20 million  Obama  has already made  

  Obama  won tonight 

 This time I was much more impressed with  Obama  s  performance   And  Romney  just supported my  opinion  that he s wrong for America in this era  

 You have got to be kidding   Decisive  win for  Obama         

  komonews  debates both did well  but  Obama  was  solid   

 If  convicted felons  could vote it would be ah  LandSlide for  Obama     TruuuStory 

 Just because I don t vote for  Obama  doesn t make me  racist   The fact that you vote for him because he s black kinda does  

 Of course  Obama  ends with 47% when he knows  Romney  can t counter   who cares that it was completely off the question   typical  debate 

 Lmao that 47% was  Obama  at the spades table wit  Romney  all jokers have been played  Obama  slams the big down and walks away wit game and set 

 And  debate number 2  goes to Barack  Obama    4MoreYears 

  Obama  won this  debate   He was in total control  

  MBalabayeva I m not    But I think  Romney  did very well considering the  moderator  seemed to lean more toward  Obama   

  Romney   You ve been Handled     Obama  hit him for six with the  47% comment   Take that  Romney     Obama 4president  2012presidentialdebate 

  Obama  believes in fairness  not ingenuity and hardwork  

 These reporters talking like  Romney  was neck 2 neck with  Obama  in this  debate   Was they watching the same debate we did   Obama  smashed dude 

  Obama  definitely did better  and  Romney  is still doing strong  But  both  of them just seemed  average    debate 

 If  democracy  represents little more than a WWE Slam  then President  Obama  played the  role  of the Big Boss Man  Debate2012 

 You can say  Obama  is all talk and no play but his views are for the greatest  middle class  via  education   He is better for america   Obama 2012 

 People who are for  Romney  are going to say  Romney  won and people who are for  Obama  are going to say  Obama  won  

 I give  Obama  a pat on the back for his  a>patience   NBCpolitics 

  Obama  is Like Kobe in the 4th quarter

  Greytdog  kate_sheppard  DavidCornDC  I don t think anyone cares about the 47%   everyone cares about what  Obama  didn t do  P

  Obama   finished  strong 

  Obama  for the win      debate  

 Don t blame that on  Obama    he s trying to create  more jobs  but you can t do that in four years 

  TheDaleJackson I think  Obama   won  slighly  but not for substance  He delivered his rhetoric   lies very well  

  Romney  was intimidated  made invalid points   Obama  genuinely cares about the  American people    Romney  cares for the wealthy  

  silkysmooth1812 I was always an  Obama  supported  Was willing to give  Romney  his shot to win me and he didn t 

  FoxCT  Romney  1   Obama  336   Not even close  

 I don t look at my  pension   it s not as big as yours  Debate   Obama  

  Obama   More  poised  fluid    natural   Achieved what he needed to  Good work  

 I believe  Obama  just got his next 4 years  

   Romney  keeps saying he knows how to create  jobs  but never says exactly how he will do it  He s a con man  Nothing more    Obama  

  Romney  is too worried about watt  Obama  is doin INSTEAD of saying watt he is trying to do  CSPAN2012 

 Y all make a  mockery  of  Obama   but hate  Romney   y all care about politics but make everything a joke     K

 From what I m seeing yet again  Obama  is the Devil and  Romney  is Satan   Politics  

 Seems to be a bigger crowd around  Obama  than  Romney    debate2012 

 the only good point  Romney  couldve made tonight is that  Obama  be winning be trying to sweet talk the  women  of America

  Obama  got too much  confidence  Mitten 

  Obama  is a good president  Romney s a Mormon from planetkolak  _  

 Ooooog I missed that  Apparently  Obama     Romney  didn t shake hands post    debate  

  Obama  should look in the camera and say   look me in my face   I ain t got no worries       

  Obama  didn t save the  47%  for the last minute   Romney  set his damn self up with his last remark about caring for 100%  

 Words for words   points by points   President  Obama  explained  corrected or just shuttled the door on     BRAVO  MR  PRESIDENT     

 I m tired of everybody talking bout the first  debate   Obama  did what was suppose to be done he studied his opponent   BeatIt 

 Why would you ask  Obama s campaign manager about her opinion  Shes obviously gonna defend  Obama  

     AnnCoulter  will love to see O in the unemployment line   Obama  clinging to his job and paycheck     

 I don t see the need to bash either of the candidates If you don t like  Obama  don t vote for him easy as that No need for all the negativity 

 my vote is for Barack  Obama  

  Romney  s strongest points  Critiquing  Obama  s 1st 4 yrs  on creating jobs  energy plan

  Obama  had 44  minutes  vs only 40 for  Romney  

 The left admits defeat  the right can never do that   Obama  won tonight  and Biden won last week 

  Obama  referenced the glass ceiling  Mah man  

 I think it s safe to say  Obama   slayed 

 Although Mittens was highly successful with his statements regarding women and Bush   Obama  s trenchant and erudite tone enabled his  victory   

  Romney  cheap shot    Obama  bringing up his  extensive experience with small businesses  and making  Obama  talk about his failures   debate 

  Obama  dominated the  debate   Nice to see he is back      Obama   CNNDebate 

  Obama   debated  better tonight  but was that enough  No  

  Obama  won 

 I think  Obama  came on strong tonight 

 Ur a goofy RT  realDonaldTrump   Obama  better than last time  but again   Mitt Romney  wins  Good night   debate 

 Instead of talking about what President  Obama  didn t do talk about what he did do  He had to come clean up the big mess President Bush 

 wish audience had asked  Obama  why he did not do all the things he continues to  pledge  to do if given 4 yrs 

 C mon   arifleischer  We both know   Obama  didn t talk ab his plans because HE DOESN T HAVE ANY   debate  cnn 

 According to survey of undecided voters at  debate   Obama  won  37%  Obama  30%  Romney  33% tie  CBSNews 

  Obama   44 mins  Romney   40 mins  debates 

 I m all for mitt and Ryan but  Obama  did good    The polls have the say in who won 

 And yet  Obama  complained about the  time   thinking that he was getting less   I didn t hear  Romney  complain about getting 4 mins  less  

  mehdirhasan he probably believes that  Obama  doesn t believe in the same god as he does or that  Obama  is a Muslim  

  xoxo_MonaeLove Again he helped FIX that  economy  after  Obama  let the entire Nations economy crash and led to all state economies crashing 

 CBS poll  37% say  Obama  won  30% say  Romney   But 65% say  Romney  would be better on the  economy   the top issue  So pretty much a push  

 Too bad third parties don t win in America  I don t like  Obama  or  Romney   honestly  But we all know  Romney  is gonna win Texas  

 The   debate  was GREAT         The President did an outstanding job   Mitt is full of LIES     President  Obama  was right on point    

   Obama  went over time  The host said time was up  His reply   this is important   IT S also important 2 follow the rules  presidentialdebate 

  jedlewison CNN doing their best to ignore own uncommitted focus group bc realtime line clearly favored  Obama   Trying to paint  Romney  win

  Obama  won the  debate  decisively  http   t co c9mCQT56 

  Obama  won How do I know The  republicans  are complaining that  Obama  had more time to speak  fact  but shows republicans know  Romney  lost 

 What I find odd though is how quickly everyone now wants to assert that  Obama  is not perfect   as if  Romney  is perfect  

  Obama  sure tries to make himself look better by lying   He needs to try a lot harder    2012PresidentialDebate 

 They let  Romney  go over just like  Obama   I guess that s fair   shrug

  Obama   talked  louder  but didn t tell us what he would differently than he is already doing  Talked a lot but said nothing  An empty suit  

 It s funny how these retired senators that are republicans are  endorsing   Obama  

 I only wish  Obama  would have shown this vigor during the last  debate    Debate2012

 Rachel Maddow on MSNBC reports a CBS flash poll of undecided voters about who won tonight s  debate   37%  Obama   30%  Romney   

 At the end of the day  my take away is that President  Obama  s best is better than  Romney  s best  Period  

  Obama  won  debate  easily 

 Hope u got 2 P    Romney   Presidential         Obama   not so much  

 2008  Obama    I believe this nation is in need for change   2012  Obama    I believe this nation is in need for change    

  MichaelSkolnik  CBSNews  Obama  won  

  bobcesca_go  Obama  lost round 1 by not showing up   Romney  lost round 2 after fighting hard   that s gotta hurt  Romney  big time  O ruled him 

  Obama  goes after  Romney  in second presidential  debate  http   t co 0wpBtr82 

 Wonder how much personal good will  Obama  sacrificed in quest to go after  Romney   His whole case is built on personal appeal  

  Selalela the  Navy Seals  couldn t do anything w o  Obama  giving the go ahead  And  Obama  trying to do what Clinton did when our country had $$ 

  danabrams If nothing else  it may energize  Obama  s base  which could be enough  they hope    debates 

  Barack Obama  President  Obama  showed his strength tonight  A lot of factually  facts  were stated from the President  Great job     

 i really wish i could  vote  for  Obama      

 I love how  Romney  supporters spin  Obama  as brash and rude tonight  but when  Romney  was assertive in the 1st  debate   he was a hero  Grow up  

 What can t be argued is that what  Obama  has done over the past four years hasn t worked  Plain and simple 

  Hrothgar_KP the situation for young white college grads under  Obama  is only going to get worse   much worse   ive studied economics 

  chrisrockoz second round  knock out  Pres  Obama   

 If  Obama  thought Libya was an act of terror  why did he   his staff come out on numerous tv shows for 2 WEEKS citing a video was to blame    

  tiffanyshlain  Debates   Float like a butterfly sting like a bee     Obama   s  47 point knockout  in the last round was just like  MuhammadAli   

  Obama  >>>  Romney  

   Liberals  are thinking that  Obama  won as clearly this time he was awake  debates  laughable 

 Didn t even watch the  debate  because I can t stand listening to  Obama  make excuses for the hundreds of thousands of lazy Americans we have  

  seanhannity Its done Mitt just embarrassed  Obama  again this president is done this president just got embarrassed twice   

 So many ignorant tweets about Mitt saying government doesn t create  jobs  but he will  POLICY will help which  Obama  has NOT done  Think  

  1rutwilldo yeah   Obama  s response to initial question was weak  The follow up question got a little weird  

  Obama  never dislike  Gov   McCain  he HATES  Romney  with a PASSION     Obama 2012  TeamBarack 

  Obama  hit a grand slam tonight  look for a 3 4 point bounce  Congrats Mr President 

  Obama  got a good point 

 My Pop was 2 stepping  yelling    Obama   earlier around the house  Now he s really excited to vote  like it s his first time  Lol 

 so help me God if people say  Romney   won   I m just done  I m just calling it quits   Obama  was a boss tonight  and  Romney  is just rude  

  TheLastWord  mitt Romney  Exactly   Obama  is an angry  spoiled child  

  kaybellor yes  A beautiful close   Romney  tries to convince us he cares for 100% when we all know what he says in private   Obama  reminds us  

  mr_webber32  Obama  did better buying don t think he won  

  Obama  delivers the final knock out    debates  

  Obama  ended with  47%      whaaaat don t make me laugh 

     CarolineManzo  I don t feel like there was a definitive winner tonight   lots of tap dancing around issues      Obama  lied  Romney  took it 

   Obama 2012 it seems it was a great night for  Obama   What will be  Romney s  next move be  

  towandabraxton  Exactly   Romney   Telling us what we want to hear  Pres   Obama  telling us what we NEED to KNOW   Team Obama  

  Obama  was so annoyed 

 check out the 2012  labor participation rate    lowest in over 10 year by US Dept of Labors own numbers   Bad  Obama   policies  are to blame  

 Moderator was way out of line helping  Obama  with the Libya lie   OMG 

  LCoop34   Obama  is a great speaker 

  seanhannity Totally agree   Obama  had nothing to bring to the  debate   

  kadeemedwards Well I don t even have something funny for this  I guess whatever  Obama  wants to do he can do  because he has heat vision  

 I m Tired Of Hearing Ppl Say The  UnEmployment Rate  Has Increased Since  Obama  Became President    

  wilw seriously   explain how  Romney  is less  experienced  than  Obama  was when he was elected  And be specific  toughquestionsfromME 

 Trickle down   Romney  or community organizer   Obama     Debate   

 Girl now you know you part of the  47%  that  Romney  was talkin bout dont front RT  FullyLifted  I do not agree with  Obama s closing argument   

  Romney  gets caught lying way to much I m not a democrat but I d much rather have a  democratic  president than a liar for president  team Obama  

 My  taxes  haven t been cut  but my insurance has thanks to  Obama    vote Romney   debates 

  mblessing2 yeah she made him doubt his facts on which he was correct on  its because Candy has almost parralel views to  Obama  on the topic 

 I dont understand   Obama  lies when there is  fact  check  We are going to find out the truth so why lie  

  timothy_stanley  allanholloway   Mitt  Romney  said  Obama  didn t talk about    acts of terror    in the Rose Garden  He did  That s it  

 I m not for all of  Obama  s  policies  but I can t vote for someone that is as bigoted as  Romney  

 Wow RT  Mike_notmichael  But    RT  LsKSwagSwag  Obama  deserves another 4 years  If he can t get the  job  done after that then he gotta go 

     JCarrizales_5      NatalyyDee  I don t want  Obama  to win      Carrizales4President        Obama  please win  

 The fact  Obama  is probably the first president to have teenagers watch the  debate  >> 

 These 2   debates  illustrate what I ve been saying for a year  election is  Obama  s to lose   Romney  can t beat him  he can only beat himself  

 What has  Obama  done in the last four years to improve America  Nothing  He lost the  debate     

 I think the point of this  debate  is  you can t beat  Obama   unless you re  Obama ^2   fb 

 Checked into Fox News to see how they re handling their candidate s defeat   Hannity  vows  to   fact check  Obama  s lies   

 Wow   this group didn t think  Obama  performed well at all   Just attacked    had no ideas  didn t answer questions   was totally on defense  

 Almost every tweet I ve seen was supporting  Obama     Then I saw that ONE that was supporting  Romney    o O 

  Obama  was organized  Romney  was free styling 

  Suttonbuttonn  Romney  doesn t want the  government  to have to pay for everyone s birth control like  Obama  care wants

 LOL Mitt just handled the 47% for President  Obama  on a golden tray  So not smart  Romney   

 I hope I can catch a replay from the debates  Sounds like it was great for  Obama   

 So   the theory that  Obama  threw the first debate to make his effort in the second one seem more impressive is certainly looking viable   

  ByronYork Truth is  Obama  pushed the movie explanation and did not  give America the truth  and he did not  give  the ambassador requested help

  Obama   lucky  its not Wednesday cause he wasn t wearing pink   HeCanSitWithMe  

  Looks like  Obama  named winner by  CBS  Google and PPP snap polls   No word from CNN poll yet   presdeb 

 Romney definitely made  Obama  look like a dimwit  saying he doesn t know why Obama would even disagree with the Canadian pipeline  

  Obama  truly does represent all   Barack Obama  pushes for equality    Who would not vote for that     

 The reason  Obama  got elected in the first place is his  smooth speeches filled with simple vocabulary   

   TeamBarack  Obama  s back        Fired Up  Ready to Go

 Never thought I would say I want  Obama  to be president    But I do   Mitt Romney  is an asshole stupid fuck who needs his dick cut off  ] 

  gretawire I think  Obama  showed himself to try to  bully voters   

  If  Obama  gets re elected  imagine how much he will  blame the previous   administration     

 FUCK FOX NEWSSS    m fuckas on  Obama s  shit      smh 

  Tonight   Romney  picked the wrong speech to slam  Obama  on  and it cost him  He opened the door  and Obama slammed it on him  

  Taxing  all millionaires at 90% would fund the government for 3 months  Great plan  Obama    debates 

  Just so you all know  I don t disagree with everything republicans believe  They have some great ideas  I just like  Obama  better than  Romney  

 Barack  Obama   plays basketball  therefore he has my vote  

 All  lies  and  phony stock market bubbles  with  Obama  and his corrupt bankers  We have massive fraud with no justice   cspanwj  tcot  cspj  p2

  Bawlz_95  Wrong  Obama  is a dumbass   

  ___ADG so many people are in debt because his  Obama  care is forcing people to have  health insurance    Even though they can t afford it

 Thank you Diane Sawyer for noticing the significant  time   Obama  received more than  Romney     

  I didn t like  Obama   but then I watched the presidential debate    and I still don t like Obama  

  I am not a huge fan of  Mitt Romney   but the choice is clear    Obama  is bad news for this country and a vote for him is a vote for socialism 

 Oh yes he can    Barack  Obama  that s my president   

  Obama  is  aggressive and poised  he s not taking Romney s shit this time

  WheresMyLiberty that doesn t even make sense  I m not supporting  Obama   I m supporting someone who actually has a shot at beating him

  On the clips President  Obama     Mitt Romney  both answered questions about the equality of women in the workplace national security   PemiluAS 

  Obama  is not perfect but he has compassion and empathy  That is more important than a fat pocket to me  

 I think  Romney and Obama  should just fight

    MittRomney  great job by the way  Nobody expected  Obama  to even show up  so that was apparently enough to get him a a passing grade 

   MeKaymi_Tensei He carried himself poorly in that  debate   but I do think the shitty moderator gave  Obama  an advantage he didn t need  

   uhlyssaoliviero   if  Obama  gets elected  guys like me will go out of business  People who pay the taxes that enable fin aid  will be gone

  ewilliam_  Obama  record on what he promised and failed to do hurts him 

 Anyone who watched that debate and didn t come away admitting that   BarackObama  cleared the floor with  Romney  is either lying or delusional  

 One thing is clear  Obama  legitimately does not like  Romney  as a person  He finds Mitt s success contemptible   debates

  Romney  making  Obama  look like shit   forrealtho

    I know people that have  healthcare  because of  Obama           I know people that have  jobs  because of Obama     via  jferg    benjaminkelley  

  TheLastWord  chucktodd  Obama  owes  Romney  nothing as Romney has never showed this President the respect he deserves  

   Obama  totally ignored nor really  nswered questions on Benghazi or   Fast   Furious      And MSM says he   won    LOL 

  Obama  wins the 2nd debate   Once the conservative commentators go for the moderator you know their candidate lost  

 First  Obama  knocked  Romney  the fuck out and then this twist on Sons of Anarchy  greattuesday

  Obama  came today full swing like a hurricane level five at  Romney   Way to go his excellency Barack Bama 

   Obama  is the truth  

  AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is   But  Obama  sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING 

  Given composition of poll  fair to say  Obama  had solid win overall but  Romney  won on economy    race likely to go down to wire  cnndebate 

   AshleyOkinawa lld I didn t say anything to harm their party   Romney  did that for himself I just commented on  Obama   

   Mitt Romney  stripped  Obama  the orator was indeed a stammerer 

   gaylortangg and  Obama  has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx  both of whom know nothing of successful nations  

  Obama  did not answer the question on Libya   Romney  missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either  

     coledixon15   Obama  is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries     llcoollittle   this guy 2 

  johnjferrie  BioAnnie1 Apparently not the independent women on TV in the focus groups who found  Rich Romney  more credible than  Obama  

   RNCResearch Heck it wasn t the lies that are the problem  it was the lack of  ideas  from  Obama   so another four years of the same  

 The Republican goal is not to beat  Obama  down  It s to shake down and beat down the American people  Keep your heads up  Obama 2012  

  If I have to listen to one more  Obama   speech   I think I will end up in a loony bin  What a grating voice  

 If  Obama  wasn t running for president would you still be excited about politics  

  From assault rifles to education   Obama  you are OWNING this  debate   Brilliant public speaker  just fucking brilliant  

 I am so pumped up right now  I cannot even sleep   TeamObama   tonight we saw why we are going to do everything we can to reelect   Obama  

 Will   BarackObama  EVER correct  Romney   The vast majority of that deficit is Bush s  particularly his 2 wars Obama finally put on the books  

 i m supporting  Obama  so much  I don t want  Mitt Romney  to be president   NoWay 

  Listen  Obama   Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league  Quit blaming other people for your problems  

  Finally just watched the debate on DVR   Heated and what I have been waiting for   Obama  was on the defensive for most of it  

  First I was gonna vote  Obama  cuz of race  then I was gonna vote  Romney  for moral reasons  but after studying   1 Samuel 8    I want neither  

  I will admit   Bush s spending was out of control  But  Obama s   spending habits     just completely unacceptable  NotFittoGovern  Debate2012 

   Obama  you got Morgan Freeman to be spokesman on one of your commercials  Well since you got God to speak highly of you  you will win  

   Obama  did  lower taxes  on middle class  No Job  No Money  Lower Taxes  lnyhbt 

  lindaph1 Hell  Obama  can t even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle  diplomatic security   BHO Admin  is a chinese cluster  

 Watching the replay of the debate on CNN   Why don t  Obama and Romney  simply go MMA cage match to settle this shit    

  Barack Obama  wins the debate  Bristol Palin voted off Dancing With The Stars  It s a great night to be a liberal in America  

 20 more days and this  Romney and Obama  shit will be over 

  keithurbahn  speechboy71  Obama  was a wuss to only bring it up when  Mitt  couldn t respond at the end  

  TheDarklady  benhowe well at least  Romney  didn t act like a PlannedParenthood Cheerleader  Please get a clue on how BAD of a Prez  Obama  is  

  I don t think either  Obama or Romney  is right for this country  what we need is a ruthless dictator  

  You might vote  Obama   but you have to admit the  Republicans  built a pretty good robot  

  Election news  CNN calls it for  Obama   FOX News calls it for  Romney   Adult Swim calls it a clear victory for Meatwad  

  Today s Presidential Debate ws OK  For me    Obama  is a winner today by an Inch  jst 1 inch  He shud b more Charged up in d nxt  last rd

  Obama  whooped both Romney and the moderator  Dayummmm  Obama2012 

  Taliban shot  Malala for her ideal was  Obama  All female fans of Brad Pitt  Justin Bieber etc should be careful in Pakistan 

 Wondering how  polls  can say Obama won the debate but  Romney  won on issues   It s hard to understand polling at times   perception  debate 

   Romney  has shown leadership    is ready to be president  Will you see a bump in polls  Probably  little bump for  Obama   But hey> 

  Obama s   voice  is so assuring  

  djbuck hardball   Obama  to presidential to bet  Mit  10G on lybyia question    just check tape   Mitts eyes big look like he swollowed canary 

 Heard  Obama  used Biden s acting coach   who evidently specializes in LYING   goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes  

   1 2  Painting  Romney  as   extreme   social conservative more risky than   flip flopper   but the payoff is bigger if  Obama  wins     

   KevinMcGil Whoooooooooaaa  Nellie      RT FOX News poll has  Obama  winning tonight s  debate by 70%   barackobama  davidaxelrod  joenbc 

   GOPrincess  interception225 6 of the  questions  were   anti   Romney  only 3 were Obama 

 Oi why are Americans so ignorant  I think  Obama  is better than any other past president 

  Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression  basically  Obama   walked  in like a pimp and ate that face  

 Wait for the foreign policy debate  stretch4444 I wish  Romney  had brought up the multitude of daily briefings missed by  Obama    

 I think it s now safe to say  Romney  is a stronger  debator  than  Obama   presidentialdebate 

  Obama s  going to expand the debt by 100 trillion dollars  Also God supports  Romney  Disprove both statements with evidence 

  Watching the first Presidential debate between  Obama and Romney  on youtube  these guys sound really intelligent  

 Michelle   Obama  broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about  Libya to save Barack s butt   MSMBias

  Boowaboowa Turns I got both right   Obama  was good last night  But  Romney  is a poor candidate disliked by even sections of his own party  

 The   Obama  legacy   Bad Policies   Poor Results   Gloomy Future  Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens  Romney 

 Students have been camping out all night to see  Obama  and more students are beginning to line up  

 I m not racist but  Obama  needs to remember that a white man built this land  A black man sold his families to the white man  

   AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power   Obama  should be your biggest enemy 

  Mr  President  please stop the cover up  You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack  We have the transcript  Obama 

  GMA who wrote this  Badly worded question   Obama  won  

  Interesting  too  that President  Obama  called Mitty on his   Social Ideas     BECAUSE  SOCIAL   PEOPLE and NOT CORPORATIONS   

  Obama  calls out on Romney about his investment on companies  Bain Capital  outsourcing American jobs to China  Sensata plant in Illinois     

   debate Rose garden presidential statement  3 53 mark   Obama  says   All Americans always     clearly not talking specifically of  Benghazi  

   keder False statemen  Obama had 14  Mitt Romney had 2  Crowley had 1   Obama  wins on falsehoods  debate2012 

  jay33231 just listening to  Obama   talk  and blatantly  lie  is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again 

 White folks treasure being considered an honorary member of an oppressed people  A Republican coworker voted  Obama  to keep his hood card  

  Best thing about the debate  If  Obama  thinks he won the first  he ll have a similarly distorted impression of the second  

  Yes   Barack Obama  LIED last night  On September 12 he was blaming a video  not terrorism  for Libya  LIED   mapoli 

 EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since  Obama  was elected  THAT will get him fired  

 If  Obama  wins this election because of women s issues   I lose faith in my gender   prolife  smallgovernment  RomneyRyan12 

 Im not a Democrat    I do have issues with the  Obama  administration     but    the right is doing a great job of demonizing not criticizing 

  Obama26Obama Let s hope WHEN  Obama  is overturned  he ends up on welfare and food stamps    

  Why is the media is claiming a win for  Obama   Actually being awake this debate doesn t count  I like him even less  he acted like a jerk  

  Obama  SHOULDN T have to keep reassuring his base after last night  Please let him speak2 secure the independent  undecideds w out criticism 

   debate If  Obama  had been telling the truth last night  he might have won   America loses when a President lies to our face   RomneyRyan 

  For a man with 4 years on the job  pres  Obama  seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction  

 Great debate for  Obama  last night I gotta say title of one of my newest song is what went down and that is  I Don t Run From Nobody  

  GayPatriot  Obama  is answering questions from US Weekly followers today  Let s overwhelm him with tough questions  

  Final proof  Obama  won the debate   FoxNews is   raising questions   about  Candy Crowley as moderator   p2  topprog  tcot 

  truth  Obama  failed on emigration reform but the republicans did to they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted  

 Why did  Romney  say unemployment rates have gone up since  Obama  took office  Wasn t there that study last week that said they d gone down  

  According to him  I m what s wrong with society because I think comparing  Obama  to Hitler is disgusting and makes no sense  

  President Obama  is worth 12million and has money over in china 

    AndrewRugg Predictably   the NYTimes and CNN  have declared  Obama  the winner and those are the MSM headlines  

 So much jabbing of the other political party on social media  It will finally end in a few weeks when  Romney  concedes the race to  Obama    p 

  I m not saying  Mitt Romney  is the answer  but I don t understand how we can give  Obama  a do over if hes going to do it the same way 

   Obama  lied about  Libya and production of coal    Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal  Not true  People in WV are unemployed 

   whoisdemichael actually  when  Obama  was a senator  he proposed the bills   approved the plans that are responsible for our nation s debt  

  Daggy1  Obama  didn t  Went straight into education  High end jobs  Prob there is  High end   low volume  We got that now in Ireland  

   DETECTIVE4LIFE  davidwebbshow yes    Obama  had rage in him  felt bad for man in audience who asked question  Out of control n too defensive 

 Don t live in America so it doesn t concern me but I want to see  Obama  lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years 

  SydneyREDtaylor I don t think either of them are talking about taking away financial aid but I do think  Obama  has helped with that a lot  

  They just said   Obama has really been pounding hard   on the news  do they even listen to themselves when they talk  haha 

   realDonaldTrump With it 2 to 1    3 min handicap   Romney  still won   Obama  lied on economy   on Libya  Smirking like The Joker Biden  

 If y all think  Romney  did an effective and thorough job last nite I m sorry ur fckn crazy PEOPLE we gotta give   BarackObama  4more years    

  Semkae I guess u didn t read the links I sent u  Even conservatives like Krauthammer and Laura Ingraham said  Obama  won  omarilyas  chiume 

  From seeing the highlights of the debate  I would really really really love to see  Romney and Obama  in a boxing ring 

   mckaycoppins exaggerates  Obama s  debate win  but true  Mitt  wants to jail women who abort 

  Obama  is gonna outsource low paying jobs  most of y all  Create more High skilled jobs   NONE of y all  

  Obama  hits back in fiery debate  A more aggressive Barack Obama buries the memory of a poor first showing as he and challenger Mitt R

 That debate was heated as F ck   Obama s  finally taking no sh t from this rat   Romney  talks so much he s foaming at the mouth  

 Just watching last nights debate  First question as usual  Romney  makes claims with no plan   Obama  gives steps to success   typical 

 All of the Obama supporters keep asking for specifics of Romney s plan  I m just asking for Obama to present any bit of a plan  

   brad4rdr   Fox News  says Romney won  Given their record of accuracy  we can be confident that Obama did  

  PoliticalTicker I can t see this  Obama  performed better than last    Romney  remained on top   Obama was defending most of the time  

 Yes  Obama  is DESTROYING the MYTH of White genetic   intellectual Superiority and   jawbreakerctc01  REM63489  bootyisyou  BarackObama TKCAL

  FTD is irking the hell outta me  Buy flowers ONCE  and they parked their asses in my inbox like  Obama   

  CNNPolitics  Romney  caught  Obama  in two times lying  That enough for me   Romney2012 

  nickbilton Agreed  I was surprised  Romney  got such a free pass on that in the first debate  I guess  Obama s  poor showing eclipsed it  

     WSJ  According to polls of undecided voters   Barack Obama  narrowly won last night s presidential  debate    A narrow win is still a win  

  President Obama s   little trips to Virginia  are really cramping my flight plans  

  TheSlimmyMan  evalongoria How did  Obama  win  Please explain  He didn t answer a single question he was asked

  President Obama  is the sort of inspirational leader that I believe the US needs  Now he needs to stop talking about China   ObamaWinsDebate 

   ObamaWinsDebate electoral college  is what counts guys  And  Obama  is smashing  Romney   

   ChicGrl427  RepubGrlProbs I don t think  Obama  won  but I see your point  

  America doesn t need  Obama   they don t need  Romney   the need a viable third option  

  Biden on debate last night   Obama  showed himself as   a man of principle  a man of  gumption  with a steady hand and a clear vision    

   Romney s  history of hiring women from his binders is noteworthy   Obama s  history of hiring from welfare list not so much   Your choice  

   Yessss  Obama  won last night debate    

  Why most Israelis want Obama reelected  Because  Barack  wants more poor to become rich   Romney   like BiBi  wants the rich to become more rich 

  americasvoice  are Latinos Libs fucking insane It s  Obama  policies which have resulted in record deportations S Comm of millions Mexicanos  

 Anyone see the irony on the left proclaiming this big debate victory when  Obama  lied to pretend he was practically a conservative   teaparty

 I find it very interesting that  Obama  criticizes Romney for having a large pension  I guess he thinks success is bad  That s the Obama way  

 I don t like  Obama or Romney   We re screwed either way  They both suck  Neither of them should be president  

 Women care more about jobs    Romney  is our best choice there   I m tired of  Obama  exploiting women as if we need federal funding   Women 

  When they were talking about immigration   Romney  called them   illegal     Obama  called them   undocumented    It s the little things  

 Key difference between  Romney   President Obama  is Romney talks about WHAT he s going to do while Obama talks about HOW he s going to do it  

  I guess everybody i follow is voting for  Obama    cus everybody bad mouthing Romney lol 

 Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he s black  

  MiaFarrow  Obama  is killing the USA as a country  But at least he gives out free food to the lazy  

   Trollpecki I thought this was Romney v Obama  not Romney v Candy and Barry 

 Seriously  you just let  Romney  talk for longer then 5 minutes but you let  Obama  talk for 2  Dumbbb     debates 

  Repeat question  repeat response from  Romney   Different talking points from  Obama    makes his answer feel fresh   debates

   Obama  clearly states his responses   Romney  only rambles about nothing 

  Obama  is consistently building his arguments while   Romney  is seemingly still looking for them  Im going in on Twitter All Night   Debates 

 Is it bad that one of the reasons that I like  Obama   in a politically unbiased way  is that he wears nice  suits    shallow 

   Romney  great answer on foreign competition   Obama  there you go again  give me 4 more years   I ll do better next time  trust me 

  MiaFarrow  mitt  looks and sounds strong   Obama  sounds desperate and deceitful  

  Romney  is not good on the  China questions   That man is sweating   debates  Obama  is strong on this  

  Obama  only makes sense 

 To make this debate more interesting Obama just needs to start rapping   justsaying 

  ilaffalot Nah I think  Romney s  gunna throw a punch at  Obama   It s getting heated  

 Seriously     Obama  is not going to bring up the 47 percent remark

 I think the only people stupid enough to vote for  Obama  again are the ones who can vote for the first time this year  smfh  getout  NObama12 

 I don t even like  Obama  that much but at least he has a bit of common sense   

 Romney is getting drowned out by both Obama and Crowley   debate

  Obama  just kicked Romney s ass with a teleprompter    debate  hofdebate 

   Romney  looks like hes  sweatin   Obama  coming through  trill  thurstonhowellthe3rd 

 I wish I could just hug  President Obama  and tell him every little thing will be okay  

  Obama  is good if he got the tennage community watching this debate 

  No doubt  Obama has gotten more time to talk  Yet if  Romney goes over by a few seconds  the President gripes to  Candy   Debate 

  Some black people our age may or may not vote for Obama  but MOST older black people out of school  working  or retired will vote for him  

  According to  Obama   Schools gun free zones  are the answer to F F  What a putz    2012debate 

 I keep asking myself   do the ppl really care what  Romney did with the money he earned and not what  Obama has done w  our money   debate 

 I m at work  What did  Obama  do that made everyone lose their shit  

  The press room busted out laughing when  Obama  said     my pension isnt as big as yours     LOL   Good comeback dawg   

  DivaStateOvMind I don t even care about all of this forreal    but  Obama  won this one  lol    Kilt that perfect hair Mitt  lol 

 Every American that I follow is obviously impressed that  Obama  is president    ___  

  Obama   Let me correct misconceptions about myself by spending the whole time attacking Mitt Romney   debates 

  Obama  says he believes in self reliance  What a joke  He believes in a nanny state  

  PresDebate There  Obama said it  The 47 percent  His closer  

  And Democrats finally breathe as Obama says   47 percent   

 Notice how  Obama  didn t need to be told to stop  

 Much better  Obama  

   Obama  wins  hands down   current2012 

 I just want  Obama  to read a bedtime story to me  I love listening to him  speak   

  Oh  so now  Obama  cares about the  military   That s funny  wasn t he just photographed saluting Marines while on the phone  Right   BS 

  Obama  is so cute      I love him  

  President Obama  Is Great Man    He Deserves More Respect Then Romney Is Giving Him   

  Obama  is now pandering  Since when does he believe in free enterprise  

 Yay  President Obama  did it hands down     Yeah buddy 

  Obama  kicked ass in this debate in my opinion   debates 

  Media  huge victory for  Obama   Reality  small victory for  Romney   debate 

 Black people make up a bunch of bullshit excuses to cover up the fact that they voting for  Obama  kuz he black lol that sh** be too hilarious 

   Obama  killed it  CNNDebate  debates forget the  Biden   absolute pimp 

 I will never stop loving watching the First Couple   No one can ever say that  Obama  doesn t love his wife   debate 

 Ughhh  Obama s   voice  makes me cringe  youareannoying  idonotlikeyou 

   jamiedupree  Obama  won  even with worse facts   Romney  fighting the moderator and BOMBING the Libya discussion cost him  

  JenGranholm  Obama  cool as the ice in my freezer cnt wait until the War Room tomorrow   

  Obama  killed it man  Good job on proving that factual error by your opponent  I m proud   

   Obama  isn t perfect  But  Romney  is a racist  judging  homophobic douchebag  

    And that s how you debate biatch      President Obama  as he looks at Romney and drops the mic and leaves the stage   DNC2012  GOP2012  tcot 

  Obama s  most important job is CINC  He failed in his mission with  Benghazi   He lost  He should be fired  Everything else is window dressing  

  Obama  must have gotten really high  oral  marks in english when he was in highschool  Probably roasted the fuck out of everyone  

   Obama  has done more in 4 years  than  Bush  has in 8  Another Republican will just leave our country in god knows what condition  nbcpolitics 

 Classic  all the moderators  thus far have all been die hard liberals pulling for Obama and Mitt still wrecks him  

  Romney asking  Obama  if he has funds offshore  Obama s face was like bitch I barely got funds inshore lol 

  Ed  stevenportnoy  ABCNewsRadio I cant believe my ears   What is wrong with people  They are so pro  Obama  they are def and blind 

  GlennWalck i think it s cause i m not FOR either of them lol although i m leaning kinda towards  Romney  cause we ve seen what  Obama  has done 

  Romney  wants to look after himself and his millionaire mates   BarackObama  is trying to help everybody by his FAIR tax policies 

 Wow  Great job  Obama  What a comeback  Lol PresidentialDebate 

 Or  Obama or mit  or big big bird or the economy or food stamps or the pell grant or jobs or education NOTHING    

  Obama  won that debate guys  

  Obama  won that shit   TeamObama 

  I love how  Obama  threw out that he thinks his daughters should have the same opportunities as   anyone else s   sons     

 Great debate performance by  President Obama   Much improved from last time 

  Obama  won that  debate hands down    Vote  barackobama    

  MonicaBrown FYI 47 percent are ecstatic about  President Obama s  performance tonight Mitt Romney  Our President is the truth  

  Foobian no matter who the fuck our president is and I think that if  Obama  stays in office that things will get better eventually    

  Everyone seems so close minded  either  Obama  or no one and that s it and that makes you ignorant  we need to know both sides 

  Obama    Same rudeness and arrogance that has been part and parcel of this presidency  Vote the bum out  

 Very impressed with   Obama  tonight  Much more engaged and prepared  No doubt about my vote  ObamaBiden2012 

   MittRomney  did amazing    Obama s  all about his broken promises and lied back to back   MittRomney    PaulRyanVP For president and vice  

   zachbraff  donald_faison I just realized if you 2 had  a baby   he d probably look like Obama in 50 years  

  When all I see is Romney this and Obama that on  my feeds   I m doing something that truly matters   breakingbad  season3

 B  Clint training  Obama  haaaard on how to lie to the American ppl  And on facial expressions  

 Well tonight  Obama  has something in common with the Yankee s  They re both losing  

  I d say  Obama  won this  debate  but it wasn t a knockout  Obama needs to defend his record better  

  Voting for   Obama  im behind him a 1 000 000% 

  Obama  always linked  Benghazi  to Cairo in order to link it with the video  He clearly did not call it a planned act or terrorism  

  I want  Obama  b c I look forward to my daughter growing up   saying    Ugh  We don t have enough men on staff  Go get my binders full of men    

   AceofSpadesHQ  jaycosttws  michellemalkin  noltenc   No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation       Pres  Obama  

  Candy Crowley  didn t do Obama any favors by lieing for him on Libya  Everybody and the world knows the truth 

  EmilyPurserSky  Obama  fought for his job last night and he may have convinced voters to give him another shot   JCBua  SkyNews

  BarackObama Will you show the video   Why  Obama  was  not  an  effective  President   you may be working for a boss now but think of ur country 

 I seriously hate how all  celebrities  are for  Obama   republicanprobs  RomneyRyan2012

 To all the  Obama  voters  your Prez is acting like he has not been Prez for the last 4 yrs   talking  abt what he plans to do with problems now 

  Obama  said he agrees w   MittRomney on lowering the corporate  tax  rate   really  Why haven t you done that in the last 4 yrs   HofstraDebate 

 A commitment I made when I was President Even  Obama  sees it in the past  tense    HofstraDebate 

  NerdRage42 no but it takes from the same program that  Obama  is jumping on Romney for wanting to cut  funds  

  Obama  is definitly  mad  now lol

  Adam_Findlay  Obama  is a  Christian

 AK 47 s used in    gang   banging     as  Obama  put it  are not purchased legally in the US   Assault Rifle ban does not solve that prob   Admend2 

 The One Thing I Can Say And I Salute  Obama  For Is The Fact That He Has Remained  HUMBLE  Throughout This Entire Election And Debate   

 Weh him just seh  The whole time he s been trying to  bash   Obama   shut dat sxxt up    

 I think  Obama s   sincere   ilikehim 

  Obama  must take advantage of  47%  now 

 While  Obama  has been staying on  topic  and doing what he s suppose to be doing and that is    

 For the idyotsss complaining how  Obama  ain t get us out of  debt  why the fuck don t u tell ME what YOU D do to fix the shit then  Hahn   

 This  moderator  needs  Obama  to  win  so the government forces her to lose weight

 Sidenote   Obama s   profile  is sexy    Now back to the debate  

 We re all children of the same God say ROmeny   Except  Obama    He s the  devil    debates 

 I hope  Obama   responds  with   i didn t say you didn t care about 100% of the ppl  You did    

 So if government doesn t create  job   mittswordsThen how is it  Obama s  fault there is no job growth 

 if we gave Bush 8 years to fuck our shit  we give  Obama  8 years to  fix  it   TeamObama 

 OKAY when is Mitt  Romney  going to  tell  us what s HE S going to do instead of what President Obama didn t do    

 It seem like  Obama  never really have time to  make  his  point  but Romney do    

 Y all see how  Obama  actually explained to us what he PLANS to do for corporate tax rates  Romney still hasnt told us any of his  plans  yet

  Obama  needs to shut up  he made our  economy  shit 

  Obama  believes in risk takers being rewarded   except when the  reward  exceeds government mandated levels   debates 

 My grandparents think  Obama  is the  antichrist  

  Obama  believes in  Free   Enterprise   but   everybody should have a fair shot   

  Crystal_Wright That s right  In fact there are 900 00 AA female entrepreneurs in the US now who  aren t   dissatisfied  with President  Obama   

  Obama  is now saying he is a republican  He is right that there needs to be more free market an less gov  control   That s what republicans do

 These  people  don t care  they just want  pictures  taken with Obama

 Of course Mr  Obama  waits to bring up  47%  at the end when  MittRomney can t explain  Wow worried  potus  

 If  Obama  don t  win  this debate       real Nigga shit      I m gonna burn to house down

 I  hate  that the  reporters  reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama  

  Obama   took  out the elite four with a metapod and no pokedex  they wouldn t even let Romney through the front door  

 What if  Obama  and  Biden  were able to tag  team  during the debate    

 He stuck his chin out and  Obama   punched  him hard   Obama2012  debate 

  the  debate  is  boring  to watch after a while  I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm  ughhhh  and well actually     anoying 

 Amazing that  Obama  would seek to dodge Benghazi and Romney would let him  In the end  Obama said the  buck  stops with him  True statement    

 is  Obama  trying to debate about guns  he doesn t know a thing about  guns  and that s  fact 

  BenjaminWavey that sounded racist against my own race hahaha but I meant I m  team   Obama   And yes

 Mamas dont let your babies  grow  up to be  Obama   let em pick guitars and drive them ol trucks cause cowboys have manners they don t interrupt 

 I don t think  Romney  was as terrible as Obama was in the first debate  But it sure felt like he got  whupped   

 this  RT  _FrenisWorld_  Ok  Obama  clearly  won   Now go to Fox and they ll say Romney won and the moderator was wrong for interrupting Romney  

  Obama  clearly  won  that debate 

  Obama  again  speaks  about four minutes longer than Romney  

  Obama   shat  on Romney  

  CNBC2012 Moderator  Candy  Crowley is  biased     You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak  She shouldnt be allowed to vote     

 Yes  it s hard to change a country in 4 years  But  Obama  knew that when he promised he would do it    And he  didn t   

 I would say  Obama   killed  it in that one Obama and Biden  2Romney and Ryan  1

  Obama  is the definition of   Clutch  

 You fail to realize that  Obama  is not from the hood  In the  hood   your life will suck no matter who the president is  

 I think the moment when  Obama  really showed he was  serious  was when the Libya subject came up  He took over with fire in his eyes 

 It s amazing how Romney criticizes   BarackObama   for what he didn t do but his  plans  will take 5 8 years to see real change   NOT BACKWARDS  

 Good  win   Obama    Well won    Easy

  ericbolling Pres   Obama   called  it an   act of terror   in the 9 12 Rose Garden speech  and then he  flew  to Las Vegas     

 If   Obama   s goal in tonights  debate  was to stem the tide of Romney s momentum  then he failed   Obama  s  actions  speak more than his words  

 Great moderation from Candy Crowley  Mitt seemed cranky and exasperated but President  Obama  was on point and intolerant of  bullshit    debate
