<e>Romney</e>: My dad was born on a family vaca to Mexico. I know about immigrants. #debate
FUCK <e>ROMNEY</e>!
People say<e> Obama</e> hasn't done anything but the things <e>Romney</e> plans on doing will not help America. ___
At least <e>Obama</e> can back his facts up\, <e>Romney</e> is bullshitting all of us.
<e>Romney</e>: "You shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to get into this country legally." I think he just shat on an entire industry there.

<e>Romney</e> just the other week called immigrants "the others". He has no plan for them.
For a second there it was like <e>Romney</e> was going to give<e> Obama</e> investment advice.
The <e>Obama </e>administration has spent trillions to bail this country out of the horrible decisions made by people like me. - <e>Mitt Romney</e>
<e>Romney</e>\, you were talking about immigration remember. Please have several seats.
<e>Romney</e> is so unprofessional
<e>Romney</e> was for shipping American jobs to China before he was against it. #debate
so the answer to gun violence is no single moms? Thanks <e>Romney</e>.  #debate
Our America is middle class America. Our America is young America. <e>Romney</e> is trying to eliminate these things. Which is why he will not win.
This isn't so bad for <e>Romney</e>.  He can easily win this without single moms\, immigrants\, the middle class or all women. #debate
<e>Romney </e>is like a broken record..
A <e>Romney </e>presidency would be great unless you're poor\, gay\, Mexican\, Black\, a woman\, a student\, or a dog. #debates #leadfromwithin
<e>Romney </e>thinks violence is caused by single moms . No boo \, I was raised by a single mom along wit others I kno . &amp; we dont rely on violence

<e>Romney </e>you don't know the struggle of growing up in a single parent home..
<e>Mitt</e>'s <a>unsure about his gun policy</a>\, so he wants to talk about something he knows a lot about: women.
Mr <e>Romney</e>\, what color is grass?   <e>Mitt Romney</e>: "when the president took office...grass was something that needed to be cut\, I love eggs...
So this debate is kinda making me pro #<e>Romney </e>#weird
<e>Romney </e>looks creepy AF just sitting on that chair\, smiling like a pyscho!!! 0_o
<e>Romney </e>keep saying "If I was president..." And "When I become president" BITCH!!!!! You're not gonna be the President!!!
Of course <e>Mitt</e> blames single moms. Republicans believe everything unfortunate that happens to women is their fault.
Wait. <e>Romney </e>is talking about two parent households on a AK-47 question? Now he pivots to Fast &amp; Furious. <e>Mitt</e> is LOST.
<e>Romney </e>just looks at <e>Obama</e> like "yeah I fucked up"
<e>Romney</e>\, Fuck around with yo fuck around\, till you fuck around and get NO votes.
#<e>Romney </e>cant even follow debate instructions\, HOW CAN HE RUN A COUNTRY
<e>Romney </e>said if you don't know your daddy\, you ain't shit...cause your mama can't raise you.

<e>Romney </e>just keeps saying what he WANTS to do. Not what he's GOING to do.
<e>Romney </e>will change the name of assault weapons to really good hunting rifles.
Yes\, <e>Romney</e>\, I see that face. But it's true\, you HAVE been called the pioneer of outsourcing.
The more I hear <e>Mitt Romney </e>talk the more liberal and binder-y I become. #debate
Anyone else starting to think <e>Romney </e>may be the antichrist?

MR. <e>ROMNEY </e>How do u spell dog?  Well u see\, dog is an easy word\, while getting a burger in AL\, a family came to me and said i lost my dog...
Trickle down government- WTF does that even mean? Idiotic and makes no sense. Oh right\, like #<e>Romney</e>
<e>Romney </e>doesn't know his facts. <e>Obama</e> politely steps in and corrects him. #bate
So basically single mothers raise killers and dope boys? Work\,<e>Mitt</e>.
<e>Mitt Romney </e>is like a Best Buy employee trying to sell you something he cannot fully explain. #debate #debate
When <e>OBAMA</e> talks : I hear Knowledge The TRUTH &amp; see a 2nd term!   When <e>Romney </e>Talks : all I hear is CHINA CHINA \,CHINA BULLSHIT CHINA BULL_
<e>Romney </e>what color is the sky? <e>Romney</e>: That's a very good question. We had a sky back when I governed Massachusetts. I like flowers.
<e>Romney </e>was solid again. <e>Obama</e>'s aggressiveness won't change a thing.  He cannot run from his record\, which <e>Romney </e>pounded consistently.
<e>Romney </e>said he was given binders full of women. damn when they ton give me binders full of women. binders nigga. binders b
<e>Romney </e>was solid again.<e> Obama</e>'s aggressiveness won't change a thing.  He cannot run from his record\, which <e>Romney </e>pounded consistently.
<e>Romney </e>strikes me as a man without empathy. It may even be a pathology. Not a good quality in a leader. #2012Debate
<e>Obama</e> clearly won this one! He won the fact check! <e>Romneys</e> always been a liar:) #romneysucks!
BINGO. <e>Romney </e>hits Fast and Furious. #debate #finally
<e>Mitt Romney </e>says that people who are voting for <e>Barack Obama</e> don't work &amp; don't pay taxes. I guess that means<e> Romney</e> is voting for Obama.
<e>Romney </e>look like he belong in a Viagra Commercial...
I don't care what you think\, <e>Romney</e> wants the rich to get richer\, and the poor to get poorer</a>. Equal America is not on his list.
<e>Romney</e> is right that family breakdown intensifies poverty: helping couples stay married is useful in fighting poverty.
Let's all just remember <e>Mitt Romney</e> is good for<a> women because he once hired one and let her leave early so she could make dinner.</a>
Wanna hear a joke? <e>Mitt Romney</e>.
<e>Romney </e>will piss China off if he labels them in a negative way. Don't bite the hand that feeds you\, sir #debate
I feel like <e>Obama</e> is for all Americans\, but<e> Romney</e> is only for a select group..
I score it <e>Romney</e> in a squeeker. POTUS landed great body shots. But <e>Romney</e> drew blood on some key issues\, that got POTUS real aggitated.
I love you <e>Obama</e>!!!!<e>Romney</e> looks grumpy tonite and ambiguous!!!!!
<e>Mitt Romney</e> is a humanitarian as long as you <a>don't consider women humans</a>. #debates #debate2012
I am <e>Romney </e>and <e>BarackObama </e>just dunk on me
i wonder if the people who like <e>romney</e> actually know he's a homophobic<a> racist sexist asswipe</a> and just choose to ignore it.
<e>Romney</e> got 3 less minutes and had to debate Candy Crowley\,  he still out performed both of them.
<e>Romney </e>directed his answers to everyone.<e> Obama</e>'s were geared toward his base.
That awkward moment when <e>Mitt Romney</e> gets fact checked to his face on live television.
<e>Mitt</e> blames <e>Obama </e>for people saying he doesn't care about 100% of Americans\, but it was Mitt who said he didn't care for 47% of them.
Winner:  <e>Romney</e>.  But <e>Obama </e>did better than a corpse (i.e.\, himself last time)\, so MSM will give it to him. #debates #teaparty #tcot
I love how <e>Romney</e> was like i care about 100% of the people. you literally just said 47% of the people pretend to be victims. get it together
<e>mitt </e>looks very presidential to me when I mute the tv\, close my left eye and look at him with only 47% of my right eye open!
This isn't so bad for <e>Romney</e>.  He can easily win this without single moms\, immigrants\, the middle class or all women. #debate
<e>Romney</e> just won me over! Done! Lets go vote!
<e>Romney</e> will show you his plan if he's elected.. And someone's uncle will show you the candy if you get in the white van.. Enough said.
<e>Romney</e> talks about women like he's never met one in his life.
<e>Mitt Romney </e>says "Government </a>does notcreate jobs</a>" so put me in charge and ill prove it? #Debate
If <e>Mitt Romney</e> can't address the questions that the moderator asks\, how will he address the issues that our nation faces ? #WeWantAnswers
<e>Mitt</e>just said he'll create more jobs but not with trickle down govt. I don't think he understands how that works bcuz that's his PLAN
<e>Mitt Romney</e> got caught <a>LYING during </a>the #debate by moderator Candy Crowley
Any woman who votes for <e>Romney</e> must hate her rights\, and have no self-respect. #ignorant
Hands down <e>Romney</e> got his ass handed to him on a presidential platter! 4 more years!!!!!!!!
I'm so confused as to what <e>Romney</e>'s plan is\, it changes every time.
<e>Mitt Romney </e>is a humanitarian as long as you don't consider women humans. #debates #debate2012
I don't think enough people touch on the fact that <e>Romney</e> acts just like a bully.
<e>Mitt</e> clearly wins on content.  <e>Obama</e> still has nothing\, but he said it louder this time...
also <e>romney </e>stop saying you made the Massachusetts education what it was... we all know that was #devalpatrick #tryagain #<e>romney</e>who?
<e>Romney</e>s opinions are simply irrelevant  like your gone lose the election why even bother competing against my homeboy <e>Obama</e>?
<e>Romney</e>'s<a> body language and condescending tone towards women</a> (including the moderator) shows the mindset of his sexist policies.
<e>Romney</e> shot himself in the foot by asking <e>obama</e> about his pension #pensionenvy
I hired a woman once. <e>Mitt Romney</e> you are a true modern day feminist ugh props to you bravo etc
Ha ha this part of the debate is such a slap in the face to <e>Romney</e>. <e>Obama</e> has a great point about a sketchy deal. #PDSLive
It was decided by the Lap Dogs that<e> Obama</e> won this #debate before he lost it. <e>Romney</e> won\, momentum stays ours. #RomneyRyan2012 #DefeatObama
I don't really have a dog in this race but<e> mitt Romney</e> is way better at this debating shit
<e>Romney</e> is a bully.
<e>Romney</e>:  <a>Government does not create jobs</a>. Please give me this government job.
<e>Romney</e> supporters are so ignorant.. They just want <e>Obama</e> out the office when clearly Romney can?t explain his views.
Also remember when <e>Romney</e> said his plan for women was "flexible hours" so they can cook and clean for their families? Because FUCK. #debates
<e>Mitt Romney</e> knows the pain of your middle class females.
I applaud <e>Mitt Romney </e>for<a> his patience</a>. It must be frustrating to be interrupted every time he tries to speak; Unimpressed by the moderator
<e>Romney </e>should be president.
<e>Obama</e> still out schmoozing with crowd\, while <e>Romney</e> is long gone. Because\, you know\, carbon-based life forms make him uncomfortable.
How totally fucked up that <e>Romney</e> links mass shootings to single parenthood. Wow. Just wow. #debate #debate2012
So <e>Romney</e> has a <a>binder full of women</a>? No little black book?

I'm suprised <e>Romney</e> let the debate go this late\, though. Shouldn't Candy Crowley be home cooking dinner for her family? #debate
I sincerely question the sanity of anyone who supports <e>Mitt Romney</e>. Especially at this point after he's said SOOOO many dumbass things.
I'm personally glad <e>Romney</e> said moms and dads and not parent and parent. #debate
<e>Mitt Romney</e>: "I care about 100% of the American people. But if you're poor\, you're as good as Chinese to me." #47Percent #hofstradebate
<e>Romney </e>said borrow money from your parents for college" bitch I can barely get $5 from my mom\, what makes you think I can get $30\,000?
Oh <e>Romney</e> your <a>sexism and blatant racism </a>would be funny if it weren't so real. #<e>Romney</e> The comments about China alone... Bro seriously?
The President talked about women as breadwinners for Americans families; <e>Mitt Romney</e> talked about them as resumes in a binder. #TeamBarack
<e>Romney</e> was a <a>disaster on immigration </a>...
This final answer by <e>Mitt Romney</e> is excellent. He's hitting all the points he should hit.
<e>Romney</e> has a binder full of women.  You know who else does?  Serial killers.

<e>Romney</e> lies so much #youtubepolitics
<e>Romney</e>: blah blah blahModerator: governor...<e>Romney</e>: *totally ignores comment* blah blah blah
 here it comes\, hope <e>Romney</e>'s ready
So <e>Romney</e> u was a pastor? its my understanding that a <a>pastor</a> is suppose to be truthful and set an example! #negative
I can't stand seeing ignorant comments about <e>Romney</e> from <a>black people</a> that totally don't even make since #pleasestfu
<a>seperation of church and state</a> is clearly going out the window if <e>Romney</e> gets elected. and thats not okay
Cheap shot referencing the <a>47%</a> remark when <e>Romney</e> doesn't get a chance to respond. #<a>debate</a>s
<a>47%</a> for the win! Debate over. You lost this one <e>Romney</e>.
Did I just hear Mitt <e>Romney</e> accuse Chinese people of hacking our computers?
 @DividendTitan Wrong\, President has encourage US business\, It is <e>Romney</e> who has the track record for <a>outsourcing and hiding money offshore</a>
 "@Talkmaster: Obama gets in <a>47%</a> in last minute .. with <e>Romney</e> unable to respond." Good strategy tho. #<a>debate</a>
 <e>Romney</e> Is Just Avoiding Question & Creating False "Facts"
 Obama: "I'll make wealthiest pay a tiny bit more" <e>Romney</e>: "I'll cut <a>Medicare\, Medicaid\, Food Stamps and Pell Grants</a> and instead" #<a>debate</a>
 Saving <a>47%</a> for closing statement\, no chance for <e>Romney</e> rebuttal? #genius #<a>debate</a>
Good job Obama! He finally called <e>Romney</e> out on that <a>47%</a>. #TeamBarack
Can we stop with the <a>47%</a> thing? Nobody cares anymore. <e>Romney</e> slipped up. It happened. It's done. Let it go. #PresidentialDebates.
 "@ItsReginaG: FOUR FOR YOU OBAMA\, YOU GO OBAMA. And none for Mitt <e>Romney</e>\, Bye." OMFG PERFECT!!!
Dear Pres. the question was about the biggest misconception of you. Not about <e>Romney</e>. Candy should have called him out. #<a>debate</a>2012
Win goes to <e>Romney</e>!!!
President Obama Is Great Man && He Deserves More Respect Then <e>Romney</e> Is Giving Him !
@littlekathzilla I honestly don't think <e>Romney</e> could do better. I don't even think he would try. He doesn't even care about <a>minorities</a>
Listening to Mitt <e>Romney</e> speak the truth>>>> Obama. #<e>Romney</e>Ryan2012 #republican
Mitt <e>Romney</e> is <a>saying what he did</a> as governor....yet Obama has nothing to say what he did as president. Hmm
 <e>Romney</e> never used the word "<a>victim</a>" in his 48% remark. #<a>debate</a>
<e>Romney</e> brings up the same points over and over again and tries to make them relevant. Obama brings up relevant points to answer questions.
At least <e>Romney</e> admitted his faith and Obama didn't go near it. #<a>debate</a>s
Obama is warm and personable. <e>Romney</e> looks like he is extremely constipated. #justsaying
 <e>Romney</e> was NOT talking about <a>veterans\, seniors\, or truly disabled citizens</a>.  He was talking about <a>those on welfare</a> that don't need it. #<a>47%</a>
Completely different <a>debate</a> than #1...different Obama & different <e>Romney</e>...will be interested 2 see exits
<e>Romney</e> did incredibly well except for <a>Libya</a> (!?). Candy shouldn't have gotten into the semantics. Twitchy's fact check: http://t.co/3bosItAu
If <e>Romney</e> becomes president im moving to Italy
 Obama\, If you say the u.s. needs all this stuff then why didnt you already change it? #youhadyourchance #<e>Romney</e>sturn
I'm at work missing the <a>debate</a> but from the looks of it <e>Romney</e> acting a fool I'm guessing...
#obama much better candidate than <e>Romney</e> just on last statement alone. #HofstraDebate
 Just realized I spent my 1\,000th tweet bashing Mitt <e>Romney</e>. I'm cool with it
@smp2004 @Mitt<e>Romney</e> If you think <e>Romney</e> won that <a>debate</a> you need your head checked out.  Obama won in a rout.
How embarrassing. Michelle Obama and Ann <e>Romney</e> wore the same dress. #<a>debate</a>
@justinbarbour I saw the last 15 and Obama seemed awesome. It was obvious <e>Romney</e> was flustered when caught out lying.
 I don't know understand why <e>Romney</e> keeps saying that we are all under "the same God" are we really?I know some who won't agree with him!
I guess the main reason I don't like <e>Romney</e> is because I want <a>religion out of politics</a>
<e>Romney</e> won this <a>debate</a>!
Candy held <e>Romney</e> in check!
I think <e>Romney</e> was the clear winner. Obama had more energy than 1st <a>debate</a> but his comments were the same old garbage.
Was really hoping <e>Romney</e> would <a>break out in song</a> when asked to talk about who he really is. Maybe Beautiful by Christina Aguilera?
 @CNBC2012 Obama surrogates try to make <e>Romney</e> look bad.  Nice try\, not successful.
What about the <a>47%</a>? Pure arithmetic means 53% only.. <e>Romney</e> doesn't care about 100% #<a>debate</a>s
 @Talkmaster and he was flat put lying. He know <e>Romney</e> wasn't talking about <a>gi bills\, SS and Medicare recipients</a>.
Tonight's <a>debate</a> bound to hurt <e>Romney</e> with <a>women voters</a> & completely shoot down his hopes with <a>single mothers</a>.
Go home <e>Romney</e>!!!!
It's gotta be ridiculously hard for Obama & <e>Romney</e> to not cut each others throats on national television.
Too bad <e>Romney</e> didn't prep in Williamsburg. That <a>debate</a> could have been closer.
<e>Romney</e> is too secretive but no matter  who wins I'm gonna pray that the best person is selected!!! #GodControl
Who hasn't <e>Romney</e> offended yet??
 It's interesting how beautiful <e>Romney</e>'s ideas on <a>bringing jobs back to the USA</a> sounded\, but also how unrealistic they were. #chinagonnachina
 God\, what a train wreck that was. Of course I believe <e>Romney</e> won; so many avoided answers from both sides though
 We'll see what the @CNN polls say\, but it couldn't be cleaner that Obama mopped the floor with Mitt <e>Romney</e> tonight #ObamaBiden2012
What are you talking about <e>Romney</e> not answering questions? He was pretty straightforward with almost all <a>his answers</a>. Not all but most
The biggest misperception I had about Mitt <e>Romney</e> is that he knows anything about people like me. #MiddleClass #current2012 #Obama
 Whether you like <e>Romney</e> or not\, he is loads better than Obama. #stopwhining
I think <e>Romney</e> has lost the <a>bird vote</a> tonight #<a>debate</a> #<a>debate</a>s
 It seems these commentators are against <e>Romney</e>\, and for Obama. Maybe not. Just seems like it.
<e>Romney</e> is charging $5 an autograph !!!
Solid win for #<e>Romney</e>!
<e>Romney</e> misleads stating Mormons have <a>pastors</a> as Christians do. Mormons have bishops not ordained clergy since they aren't Christian. #news
CNN's John King just said <e>Romney</e> won the <a>debate</a>. #WiggaPlease
@michellemalkin no doubt <e>Romney</e> won big time!
Obama saves his <a>47%</a> jab knowing <e>Romney</e> couldn't respond. A Mortal Kombat/Scorpion 'Finish Him' moment. #<a>debate</a>
@Obama2012 Voting for <e>Romney</e>.
It was clear Obama was rehearsed to push <e>Romney</e> and that clock every second with that moderator lol
 I feel like if <e>Romney</e> win\, it'll be much harder for me to move to NY
I wouldn't vote for either <e>Romney</e> or Obama but if I had to choose between the two of them I would definitely vote for Obama
Mitt <e>Romney</e> needs to drop out of the race and concede defeat to Obama
 I don't really care what you say\, but #<e>Romney</e> is way better at this <a>debating</a> shit.#CantAfford4More #Debates
 "I believe Governor <e>Romney</e> is a good man.  I believe that he said behind closed doors that <a>47%</a> of Americans are victims" - President Obama
<e>Romney</e> can try again in 2016
Oop RT @JoyVBehar: <e>Romney</e> said he sat cross the table from people who lost their <a>jobs</a>. That's because he fired them#current2022
 President Obama says.... Your <a>pension</a> is MUCH BIGGER than mine\, <e>Romney</e>!
 Obama\, thank you for calling <e>Romney</e> out on all his lies. Great work tonight. #<a>debate</a> #vote #rockthevote
Obama really needed to shut up tonight during this <a>debate</a> #pissesmeoff #<e>Romney</e>2012
 Steve Schmidt makes great point - if Obama had done this in <a>first <a>debate</a></a>\, race would be over. But <e>Romney</e> still very much alive now.
That was intense. Good to see Obama finally show up. He has more passion than <e>Romney</e> because he believes in <a>ALL of America</a>. #Debate2012
OBAMA WINS!!! <e>Romney</e> sounded like a broken record. <e>Romney</e> said the word <a>jobs</a> when the question was about cartoons.
If This Cracker <e>Romney</e> Win...I'm Moving To China...Imma Become The Next Karate Kid!!!
 #<a>debate</a>s <e>Romney</e> did Good even if hindered by 2 <a>democrats</a>\, Crowly&Obama
 Obama did not shift the momentum back from <e>Romney</e>.  Thus\, it's a <e>Romney</e> win tonight. #fb #<a>debate</a>
@timvandenack Nah <e>Romney</e> has already clarified it. I guess if you are naive you might buy it.
 #fact if <e>Romney</e> wins\, Chicago will not have a <a>presidential visit</a> for atleast 4 years
 I'm for Obama and the democratic party but let's just say if <e>Romney</e> was black \, would y'all still hate him?
I think after this <a>debate</a> even <e>Romney</e> supporters should question his character
 <e>Romney</e> wasn't bad in Truth\, But Obama Acquitted himself Nicely & stepped his game UP
Obama >>>> <e>Romney</e>.
 My questions for <e>Romney</e> will never be answered\, I feel.. But on a positive note\, Obama went out with a bang!! #Forward2012
@RyanSeacrest Obama! <e>Romney</e> was just spewing lies!!
 @KatieCumlander <e>Romney</e> said he believed in <a>God<a>. I know\, it shocked me too!
So what's <e>Romney</e>'s stance on <a>tanning tax</a>? I think that may be the deciding factor of my vote.
At the end of that <a>debate</a> Obama is still a dumbass. And <e>Romney</e> is still stuck in one state.
Wow Obama... Just wow. I pray to god that <e>Romney</e> gets in office. I don't know if America will last another 4 years with Obama...
 @SophiaBush This isn't so bad for <e>Romney</e>.  He can easily win this without single moms\, immigrants\, the middle class or all women hahah
What if <e>Romney</e> wins.
Ways to make better <e>Romney</e>-Obama <a>debate</a>s: First one who can accurately explain the infield fly rule wins.
If your going for <e>Romney</e> you obviously don't wanna go to <a>college</a>
Post <a>debate</a>- people of color vying for Obama's attention. Fewer people around <e>Romney</e>. #<a>debate</a>
 @RyanSeacrest Obama won. <e>Romney</e> has some good ideas\, justNeeds to be in the other party.
Just vote for Barack Obama because this time he has the red tie and <e>Romney</e>'s blue tie made him look feminine and indecisive #<a>debate</a>
 Wait\, they think it was a narrow win for Obama? Seriously?! I'd say 70-30 Obama\, easy. <e>Romney</e> can kick rocks with his <a>47%</a>.
 Maybe I fell asleep for a second\, but can anyone tell me what <e>Romney</e> said his plan is? Oh??_
This lady just said <e>Romney</e> was incredible and democrats want to keep your kids DUMB DUMB DUMB!
 "<e>Romney</e> offended literally every woman that I know." -my wife
<e>Romney</e> wins the second <a>debate</a>.
 Danish TV is of the opinion\, that <e>Romney</e> won this <a>debate</a> by a whisker #lolwut
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> refers to Facebook as "lady <a>binders</a>."
I'm afraid <e>Romney</e> mentions <a>God</a> just to win over voters. And what's sad is that it's working. That can't be your reason to elect someone
That is so obvious to point who's lowkey racist when it comes to the people supporting <e>Romney</e>
@Money23Green Folks who says that must be voting for <e>Romney</e> cause he's white...
Why doesn't Mitt <e>Romney</e> just go live in Canada...
 @chrisrockoz #<a>debate</a>s DUH <e>Romney</e> isn't running for president of Mexicans\, or dogs! Poor & blacks WAY worse under Obama fact check it out
<e>Romney</e> refers to <a>Massachusetts</a> a lot #nobodycaresaboutmassachusetts
Mitt <e>Romney</e> probably owns the <a>counterfeit Apple store</a> in <a>China</a>. Stop bullshitting us.
 #TeamBarack RT @woodhouseb: Crushed it!! Governor <e>Romney</e>\, please proceed.
 Obama got more time\, but we all gained more from <e>Romney</e>. #qualityoverquantity #<a>debate</a>
lmao RT @KennethEdwards_: <e>Romney</e> nice attempt..u still get your complimentary photo with the president
i watched the <a>debate</a> without logging on twitter.  I think <e>Romney</e> did very well. <e>Romney</e> still credible & Obama has ZERO 2nd Term agenda.
#<e>Romney</e> supporters think #Obama supporters are ignorant. Then again all <a>republicans</a> think everyone is ignorant
@Heminator <e>Romney</e> won the <a>debate</a> again....
<e>Romney</e> missed several opportunities to expose Obama as the Marxist liar he really is
 I'm just watching the <a>debate</a> now\, Obama is destroying <e>Romney</e> in the Libya part.
Did Mitt <e>Romney</e> say he cares about 100% of Americans? You 53% should be mad that idiot cant pick a side and stick to it! #FlipFlopper
 @CarolineManzo I'd like <e>Romney</e>\, just once\, to be specific!   What exactly are the credits he plans to cuts to <a>tax</a> payers?   no answer
Haha I agree! The only thing <e>Romney</e> addressed with <a>working women</a> was making sure they get home to make dinner -___- lol #nobueno
 Here we go.. "Obama was angry\, <e>Romney</e> was much more pleasant"  #CNN did I call this last week or what #prophetik
 If you're a <a>woman</a> voting for <e>Romney</e>\, I have no respect for you since you obviously have no respect for yourself.
Obama doesn't even have a eligable opponent <e>Romney</e> is incompitent.
 riiiiiight RT @realDonaldTrump: Obama better than last time\, but again\, @Mitt<e>Romney</e> wins. Good night. #<a>debate</a>
<e>Romney</e> caught on the <a>Libya</a> thing -- Obama did say it was terrorism next day -- but public kept talking about the video -- Crowley is right.
I'm in that <a>47%</a> that <e>Romney</e> doesn't care about!
 <e>Romney</e> alienated women\, self-immolated on <a>Benghazi</a>\, squabbled & squirmed & Obama reminded us why he's president & should be again.
This #Saltine on @CNN just said Mitt <e>Romney</e> was more pleasant than President Obama and this other #Saltine said President Obama has no plan!
<e>Romney</e> working Fast and Furious into the commentary - despite getting slapped down by Crowley - was brilliant. @FoxNews #<a>debate</a>2012
 To be real \, theres WAY too much <a>black people</a> & wanna be black people for <e>Romney</e> to even think <-- of winning.
<e>Romney</e> seems to be a hot head redneck ....
 this really proves how deep color is. bc if <e>Romney</e> is the only white option yet he does absolutely nothing for America\, what are we doing?
 Lmao I'd love to see that "@DaneCook: When do Obama & <e>Romney</e> head outside to compete on the Wipeout obstacle course? #<a>debate</a>"
 U say u wont vote <e>Romney</e> cause he is mormon\,thats like me saying no Obama cause he is black\,race&religion have nothing to do with it!  #wtf
all the reasons why <e>Romney</e> is a bad candidate have no political reasoning behind it....? #stop
 Also\, Obama didn't end the <a>war</a> in <a>Iraq</a>. Like\, that just happened when he was president. That doesn't mean he did it. #<e>Romney</e>
I had to turn from CNN... Draw? Obama had daggers in his eyes? <e>Romney</e> was pleasant? Idiots. All of em. #PresDebate2012
Lol @ people who say <e>Romney</e> is only for the rich. If you watched the <a>debate</a> you would know that it's just obama's advertisement
Did anyone hear one single deduction <e>Romney</e> would close to pay for his ridiculous <a>tax cut</a>? #<a>debate</a>
I got bare reasons to not vote for <e>Romney</e>
 When <e>Romney</e> was strive he was right\, when Obama and Biden did it out was wrong.  I see a pattern.
 @electrobeijing buahahaha no I'm not athiest. I love God\, but that's my opinion. I don't preach my <a>God</a> to everyone. Like <e>Romney</e>.
<e>Romney</e> had a script for the 1st <a>Debate</a>... Obama didn't... <e>Romney</e>'s facts in the 1st <a>debate</a> were inaccurate.
<e>Romney</e> was ripped off by the moderator lying to cover Obama on <a>Libya</a>
How the hell <e>Romney</e> win ? They better sit down !
<e>Romney</e> Isnt Gonna Win .
 Are gay men included in the <a>binders full of women</a>\, <e>Romney</e>? I'm not sure since you see neither as people.
O_o RT @msnbc: <e>Romney</e> somehow connects gun control to making sure people are married before they have kids. #msnbc2012
Why do people always say <e>Romney</e> crushes Obama in the <a>debate</a>s? Just because he sounds confident doesn't mean he has good content.
 At the <a>debate</a>\, <e>Romney</e> said he looked through "<a>binders of women</a>" to find female employees. That sounds like what I did with my last film...
Man <e>Romney</e> got all <a>single mothers</a> pissed right now
 The <a>debate</a> was pretty even till the end. Then <e>Romney</e> hit a home run out of the park\, while BHO continued to equivocate. @Lrihendry
Guess why <e>Romney</e> cant overturn Roe vs Wade? Because of the fair minded supreme court justices this administration has appointed! #Obama
 <e>Romney</e> you're a lost soul my man. Stick to being a "priest!"
 That <a>debate</a> was all Obama and <e>Romney</e> looks like a "sketch deal" salesman.  <e>Romney</e> manipulated facts\, got big pieces wrong\, dodged.
@maddow  Obama won the <a>debate</a>! <e>Romney</e> was rattled early. Great job Mr. President!
Pretty sure <e>Romney</e> lost all the <a>single parents</a> votes talkin that bullshit! I didnt get married first and joshua wont round shootin ppl!!
<e>Romney</e> still leads on economy after the <a>debate</a>. That is what will decide the election. #<a>debate</a>
 @Maribo17 <e>Romney</e> said he had a "<a>binder full of women</a>" in his cabinet.
I found a site with all the details on Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s $5 trillion tax plan. It's as simple as clicking a button. http://t.co/LtbTeR9A
<e>Romney</e> is a puppet! Ryan is actually more qualified to run for the oval office in my opinion. #Unqualified
I just really hate <e>Romney</e>. Stop slandering Obama and beating around the damn bush. Just speak your peace and focus on your platform.
<e>Romney</e> needs a slap
<e>Romney</e> came for the <a>illegal immigrants</a> tonight....Welp he better know his stay in South Florida for the next <a>debate</a> will not be pleasant
I Guarantee All Blks Vote For Obama And All Whts Vote For <e>Romney</e>..
Pres. Obama performed much better today than he did in the previous <a>debate</a>. Candy Croly fact checked <e>Romney</e> on the Libya question. #Debates.
#PMT<a>debate</a> Obama has done his homework! Really sharp today n hiting hard! callin <e>Romney</e> #liar #offensive!no #<a>47%</a> @itsmainakageni #Teamobama
<e>Romney</e> spent the ENTIRE <a>debate</a> talking about what Obama hasn't done!
 @toddschnitt <e>Romney</e> 2 - Obama 0... Obama can only say\, It wasn't my fault! Nothing he says are facts at all. He is the one that lies!!
If <e>Romney</e> is beating around anwsering the questions to give a solution! He's gone beat around getting the solution done!
I'm still very disturbed about <e>Romney</e> comments on <a>immigration</a>..These are ppl w/ dreams and skills..Pay attention he threw them 2 the wolves
@BillSpadea @ChasingNJ I think <e>Romney</e> will lose ground because he was riding a wave of 1st <a>debate</a>.  If that slows its a net loss.
 <e>Romney</e> doesn't exactly grab the <a>middle-low-class</a> votes by repeating what Obama said.. Obama put <e>Romney</e> on blast with that "Me Too" bit.
 The analyst say <e>Romney</e> won on economy\, Obama won on <a>Middle class</a> solutions. I think Obama won hands down.
Lol RT @Oh_Zee_Oh Only the top 2% of Americans should be voting for <e>Romney</e>!! That is all!
What is it with <e>Romney</e> and his love of Canada?  #MittLovesCanada #<a>debate</a>s
 @<e>Romney</e>Response - GREAT JOB\, PRESIDENT <e>Romney</e>!!  NOBAMA was on his heels all night long; he lied flat out about Libya - fix that next!
 Overheard: BREAKING NEWS: Not every woman in America wants children\, Mitt <e>Romney</e>. http://t.co/0pGw7Fs0
 Obama cares about the <a>college kids</a>\, <a>immigrants</a>\, and everybody else. Mitt <e>Romney</e> cares about the $$$$$$$
@sethmeyers21 Does <e>Romney</e> get 3 pts for mentioning <a>China</a>??? I lost track.
@jordangauger Making money is huge!!! <e>Romney</e> has created more jobs in his companies than obama has in his 4 years as pres
 My take on <a>debate</a>: Obama did better than last <a>debate</a>\, but not good enough. <e>Romney</e> held his own. Both had hits & misses\, but <e>Romney</e> won.
 "@RepLoganbill: CNN speaker - <e>Romney</e> hurt himself with <a>women</a>? He stabbed himself in the foot!!!" I was thinking another part of his anatomy.
Oh God of politics please don't let <e>Romney</e> win...
I know <e>Romney</e> is going to somehow bring up the <a>47%</a> issue in the last <a>debate</a>. He's not going to let Obama get the absolute last word.
 @NBCNews <a>Oil production</a> on Federal land "Is Up" <e>Romney</e>? Again\, Obama was right #nbcpolitics
 @JoshHarkinson Even better that <e>Romney</e> brought it up himself by mentioning "caring about 100%" just prior.
 @djmillerJA <a>Libya</a> was the killer for <e>Romney</e>\, they live on it on fox news every damn day
have a feeling <e>Romney</e> is going to win
#Obama #2013!!! Poor #<e>Romney</e> just can't seem to get his facts straight.. #lmfao
 That <a>debate</a> got heated! <e>Romney</e> almost brought the Chicago out of Obama. I bet he has a cigarette when he gets out of there! <e>Romney</e>\, a xanax.
<e>Romney</e> wants to spend 2 trillion for <a>new military programs</a> that they haven't even asked for/requested. And he doesn't deny that!
 @PaulRyanVP @AlexaShrugged not according to fair & balanced FOX news. They say 50/50. I say B S! <e>Romney</e> won again\, period!
 So people are mad because Obama didn't mention anything about God like <e>Romney</e> did? I was confused\, I thought this was a <a>debate</a> not church.
<e>Romney</e> Was Red as Hell By the End of the <a>Debate</a>
 As a <a>woman</a>\, I truly do not understand how other self-respecting women would vote for <e>Romney</e>. @BarackObama has my vote 100% #Obama2012
The President will sleep well tonight. <e>Romney</e> won't.  #<a>debate</a>s
Obama never answered a question...why is that?  <e>Romney</e> told us his <a>plans</a>...we didn't need to hear it again from Obama...answer the questions
 Just give <e>Romney</e> and Obama some boxing gloves\, and let them battle it out. #PDSLive
I felt like neither told us what they WILL do. <e>Romney</e> attacking what Obama has done. Obama defending what he has done.
The sad part about the election is if you live in TX or LA those electoral votes are most definitely going to <e>Romney</e>. smh
Obama won the <a>debate</a> with 37% vote compared to <e>Romney</e> with 30%
 When are Americans going to stand up to the <a>liberal media</a>\, moderators\, staged  "undecided" voters? When we elect <e>Romney</e> on Nov. 6! #Debate
#FourMoreYears To turn what BUSH made a big mess. You dont see <e>Romney</e> talk about what BUSH did to the country. Let Obama change it back!!!
 With apologies to Howard Cosell\, "<e>Romney</e> goes down!" @Jimmyspolitics @billmaher #nbcpolitics
Are <e>Romney</e> supporters really circling their wagons right now? Come on. He not only lost. He was embarrassed.
@donnabrazile best line and best point was Obama telling <e>Romney</e> he wouldn't invest if he wad told investments economic specifics
@airjordanik23 yeah loved that the moderator wasn't a pushover this time and rattled <e>Romney</e> some.
 <e>Romney</e> was exposed tonight. There is very little the President could have done better with. <e>Romney</e> played the bully\, Obama played the hero.
Do people even know why they're gonna vote for Obama instead of <e>Romney</e>?
Just glad <e>Romney</e> didn't wander around in the background like McCain did 4 years ago #<a>debate</a>s
If that was to me you're stupid af this election is gonna make a small change in our life's and I'll tell why because if <e>Romney</e> wins he's
 @billmaher HaHa! How 'bout 3 <a>racist comments</a> in 1 answer "what about food stamps" as <e>Romney</e> gestures towards the black man who asked
 Smart that Obama's campaign team took <e>Romney</e>'s trending "100% of Americans" quote and sponsored it. #boom
 Obama to <e>Romney</e>: "<a>My pension is not as big as yours</a>". So O basically attacked R for pursuing the successful American dream?
 @BarackObama You did a wonderful job tonight. Hope you win b/c I'm Canadian\, & we can't afford a <e>Romney</e>-Harper partnership. #<a>debate</a>s
 Watching the <a>debate</a> with the hubby\, and i must say that <e>Romney</e> is very disrespectful. smh.
 Krautjhammer is wrong\, <e>Romney</e> won on points.

 @Rafalca<e>Romney</e> Krauthammer on Fox: Obama won on points but overall\, <e>Romney</e> won... and back to <a>Lybia</a>... My head hurts - no more fox
 Obama used to be the junior senator of Illinois\,so um..stop saying <e>Romney</e> wouldn't have enough experience. Argue somethin real guys.
I dislike <e>Romney</e>. A lot.
I still believe Obama did bad the 1st <a>debate</a> purposely... To have better knowledge & feeling on <e>Romney</e>. ??_
<e>Romney</e> for sure would have fought AGAINST us during the <a>women's right movement</a>. And oh God the civil rights movement?? #Obama2012
 2nd reason \, Mitt <e>Romney</e> family owned <a>slaves</a> . 3rd he hasn't fully given a direct legit plan on how he would make changes.
A lie is a lie. The truth is the true....... Mitt <e>Romney</e> likes to throw the rock and hide his hand..........
Everyone whos voting for <e>Romney</e> I hope yall got money for <a>college</a>!!
 @_BIGGIE__smalls No way\, impossible....the <e>Romney</e>-Ryan plan is to never give specifics on their promises...
 In the @CBSNews Instant Poll\, 65% say <e>Romney</e> won on the issue of the economy. 34% say Obama won on the economy.??²
#HofstraDebate <e>Romney</e> lies and got caught in them tonight
 Bush supports <e>Romney</e>\, just throwing that out there #RoundTwo
 @johnberman-- Fact Check - <e>Romney</e> gets "true\, but misleading" (GREEN)\, POTUS gets\, "False with exceptions" (RED)...#TeamBiteMeCNN
@ABC  I thought <e>Romney</e> was very rude to Candy. Is this how he will treat all women?
 #Obama is a responsible President and has kept sound principles.  Going against #<a>China</a> on currency issues is wrong\, Mr. <e>Romney</e>!  #cspan2012
@pwanyonyi #Obama tried to put a straight face  perhaps to scare #<e>Romney</e> from his constant interference
Crowley questions <e>Romney</e> math to his face. Did they clank audibly when she stood up?
 Ladies\, remember...<e>Romney</e>'s idea of removing the glass ceiling is letting you leave early to get dinner ready #<a>debate</a>
 My wife and daughter will NEVER be in your binder\, #<e>Romney</e>.
 @Xnives Oh Yeah\, watched the whole thing...  <e>Romney</e> is a Liar\, he's never to the point\, and He's not going to make a good president.
@Hobokiller26 <e>Romney</e> used it as an example of spending cuts he would make to reduce <a>federal budget</a>
 But during his political career\, <e>Romney</e> has flip-flopped on whether he actually wanted to serve in <a>Vietnam</a>.
THIS RT @collegepolitico <e>Romney</e> won but Obama did enough to let the liberal media write the comeback narrative they wanted to
Looks like <e>Romney</e> won. #MERICA
 @PoliticalTicker I refuse to take a 2$/hr job\, as <e>Romney</e> would have it by magically bringing <a>jobs</a> back from China #CNNDebate.
@CBSNews <e>Romney</e> could have taken O to the mat with a knock out!! But he is a respectful gentleman &the country KNOWS the truth on <a>Libya</a>!!
 How much do u want to bet that all my lovely Clemson belles except one\, watched the <a>debate</a>\, still don't understand and still\, back <e>Romney</e>.
Sorry <e>Romney</e> but I was raised by my mom only....I apologize for being a success and defying your theories...
How many times did Mitt <e>Romney</e> Mis Fire? President Obama Throw 100% of his  punches and landed 92% of them.
Job Done. Hopefully it will stop <e>Romney</e>'s momentum. Unlikely to shift polls much though.
 Oh god\, "clashing protests" on Hempstead Tpke? That must have been uncomfortable for the <e>Romney</e> supporters.
Why does Mitt <e>Romney</e> keep citing studies after saying they aren't reliable in the first <a>debate</a>? #PDSLive
 @Follow_Me_Ho3 BOL ! I Liked When <e>Romney</e> Interrupted Him And He Was Like "It's Okay\, I'm Used To Gettin Interrupted . <e>Romney</e> Has No <a>Manners</a>"
#Obamawontonight <e>Romney</e> no details only I would or I wouldn't. OBAMA nice job especially on the attacks on <a>foreign policy</a>. You will win 2012
 But who knows\, he's attacking <e>Romney</e> for not offering up policy details.. How about you start by offering up your plan! #NoMoreCouchPotatoes
 Even then\, we still can't deal with <e>Romney</e>!RT @AriesWeAre: #Aries don't deal with stupid people\, unless we are in the mood for a little fun.
@SamFeistCNN but let me guess they loved <e>Romney</e> lie about <a>100%</a>
Maybe <e>Romney</e> should go run him a business and leave our president to run this country..
 "I was all for <e>Romney</e> after <a>debate</a> 1\, now I'm for Obama. Guess my vote'll be decided by the 3rd <a>debate</a>\," said nobody at all.
@markdewes But markets are global and the companies that <e>Romney</e> is fighting for support <a>China's</a> actions through their actions.
If Ann #<e>Romney</e> can't get Mitt to respect <a>women</a> and their reproductive rights he is indeed a lost cause.
 That's cool that <e>Romney</e>'s state is <a>ranked</a> first in <a>education</a> in a country ranked 31st\, way to go bro #<a>debate</a>s
 <e>Romney</e>\, why should Obama answer your question specifically when you've yet to answer 1 question fully in the entire <a>election</a> cycle? #pdslive
Funniest part of the #<a>debate</a> was when <e>Romney</e> talked about the 'Binders Full of Women.' I would love to see these <a>binders</a> :-)
@speechboy71 Exactly. It could be <e>Romney</e>'s worst <a>debate</a> at the worst possible time
@KarlRove not to mention  all of CC's interruptions of <e>Romney</e> and correcting him and directing BO how to answer.
@maumau_correa 1. How do you prosecute a state that's shouldering most of our <a>national debt</a>? 2. <e>Romney</e>'s hypocritically invested in China.
President Obama: Gov. <e>Romney</e> you're not gonna get tough on <a>China</a>!
Obama did drop the mic on <e>Romney</e> doe
I believe him. #<e>Romney</e> #<a>debate</a>2012
 You all call people who are voting for <e>Romney</e> all these horrible things\, but I can guarantee you they aren't.
I don't trust Mitt <e>Romney</e> tho. I genuinely feel he doesn't care a bit for anyone who isn't well-off enough to help further his own interests
I've only seen gay people say nice things towards Obama. And I've only see old white folks say nice things about <e>Romney</e>. Hmmmmmmm
@TVMoJoe I believe <e>Romney</e> was saying that the Pres. was out apologizing for an unrelated issue & not discussing what really happened.
 <e>Romney</e>-bot suffered a partial break down resulting in him not going to shake hands with the crowd. After a few repairs\, he was functional.
 "I knew a poor person once. Being poor is bad." -<e>Romney</e> #cspan2012 #obama2012
#CNN<a>debate</a> RT @JoyVBehar: <e>Romney</e> said he sat cross the table from <a>people who lost their jobs</a>. That's because he fired them #<a>debate</a>
 Okay to the <a>immigrants</a> & <a>women</a> complaining about <e>Romney</e>\, my mother is both\, and is very successful. Go get a job and stfu.
@michellemalkin  Mitt <e>Romney</e> won given it's 2 against 1.  Why do these moderators think they have to help O?
@Jamie_Kuntz if <e>Romney</e> was pro <a>gay marriage</a> and Obama never came out for it; does it make the choice harder for gays?
 By Oprah\, so <e>Romney</e> knows how to handle <a>money</a>.
 I believe immigration was <e>Romney</e>'s strongest point\, he dropped the ball on <a>Benghazi</a> and we just have to choose between <a>public/private jobs</a>
<e>Romney</e> is brilliant at taking a hard question and stepping around the answer with a complicated word salad.
CNN was stupid happy when <e>Romney</e> won the <a>debate</a> last time..Now Obama won this <a>debate</a> and I don't hear them saying he won at all
 I feel that Mittens <e>Romney</e> is not only a liar\, but he is very rude. i was appalled that he specifically told the moderator "no"
 but they wanted to talk about Biden smh RT @temitime: Obama did well\, he was assertive and so was <e>Romney</e> too but <e>Romney</e> was rude on severa..
 "I hired a woman once." -- Mitt <e>Romney</e>\, Paragon of <a>Feminism</a> and equality.
Everytime <e>Romney</e> lies take a shot! #GTV Have poison control on speed dial deaux lol
@TheFriddle what did u think? I thought <e>Romney</e> did great. Obama is no longer a great politician. #lnyhbt
 Did Obama say\,"Candy let's move on"1 or 2 times when <e>Romney</e> cornered him.He did it in 1st <a>debate</a>.too MSM would never allow <e>Romney</e> to do that
Who thought <e>Romney</e> won?
@Brantre123 @danabrams. Agree.  <e>Romney</e> sounded like the business man while obama sounded like a bureaucrat.
@Mitt<e>Romney</e> @BarackObama A <e>Romney</e> presidency may mean no more <a>mortgage deduction</a>. That will surely help the <a>middle class</a>.
Hi I'm <e>Romney</e>... I would rather argue than actually answer a question. And that will be the last I will try to speak of this election.
Take a drink every time <e>Romney</e> says the middle class has been buried? - #DrinkingGame http://t.co/Qd8lZ40V
My favorite part of the <a>debate</a>s is the fact checkers bringing down the D hammer on <e>Romney</e>.
@BretBaier @foxnews @megynkelly good job! Tough <a>debate</a> but good show for <e>Romney</e>!
 RT_ @LatinosObama (Latinos r for Obama)"Mitt <e>Romney</e>: Rude to the black President. Rude to the female mode... http://t.co/rdoIRGCe #ATLAT
@RyIsOn That's what I thought where Obama <a>showed</a> his <a>leadership</a> unlike <e>Romney</e> talking about Russia from long ago wtf >_>
De-nile is not just a river in Egypt it is the state of the Obamaites on the Debate. Governor <e>Romney</e> took it hands down @FoxNews
@tnyCloseRead Obama got in the <a>%47</a> big blow at the end!  Thanks <e>Romney</e> for the %100 opening!
 Unless your family is making 250\,000 a year\, you're not <a>middle class</a> to <e>Romney</e> and he's not going to help you.
@FoxNews Americans may have finally woke up and seen how much damage obama has done to this country #<e>Romney</e> 2012
Obama and <e>Romney</e> looked Like they wanted to fight.
 Why is everybody like "<e>Romney</e> better not be president!" i mean he is obviously not gunna win... -_-

If <e>Romney</e> just wants to just use effective <a>tax rates</a> w/ no <a>deductions</a> than say that #PDSLive #youtubepolitics
Massive improvement Pres. Obama. He out played <e>Romney</e>
 #PDSLive <e>Romney</e> seemed to keep going back on points that Obama revealed last week\,He needs to forget the last <a>debate</a> and focus on thepresent
 Both <e>Romney</e> and Obama are #outoftouch with the general <a>population</a>\, it's just really sad
@BarackObama the best plan is pack <e>Romney</e> wants his office!
@realDonaldTrump @Mitt<e>Romney</e> You live in the land of make believe since Obama slammed <e>Romney</e>s lies.
 Just realized that both\, did not answer major questions - <e>Romney</e>\, on how the math in his <a>tax plan</a> makes sense. #POTUS on the Libya incident.
@eyewitnessnyc if you make less money than <e>Romney</e> you can't afford to be a republican. VOTE OBAMA
@BarackObama <e>Romney</e> is rude and arrogant Vote Obama
John Kerry calling <e>Romney</e> inconsistent. LOL.
@bethangsioco Big Bird @BlGBlRDRetweet if you think Obama won. Consult a psychiatrist if you think <e>Romney</e> won.
Watching #<e>Romney</e> and #Obama #<a>debate</a> proves how much of a true leader President Obama is #p2 #Dem #GOP #politics
 You can look at <e>Romney</e> face during the <a>debate</a>...that "little fella" was shooked! No little boys in a Big Boy's game kid! #BarackObama2012
 Actually <e>Romney</e> did do bad at all tonight. All that he did was say what he needed to say\, and he said it clearly. #ClearlyTheWinner
@edshow <e>Romney</e>'s disrespect to Candy shows how he bullies <a>women</a>
 <e>Romney</e>: I will create more jobs\, I know how\, I will do it. Student: Okay\, how?<e>Romney</e>: I will create the <a>jobs</a>. Student: -______-
John Kerry: Mitt <e>Romney</e> keeps changing.... You just can't trust this guy.
 I heard that <e>Romney</e> was a <a>morman</a>? Dont know if thats true\, but I know some other Mormans and their no different\, and they are really nice.
 When his turn came on the <a>Libya question</a>\, why didn't <e>Romney</e> just say "Mr. President\, answer the question?  Who denied the add'l protection?"
I think <e>Romney</e> DOES care about the <a>47%</a>...he cares that they've now heard his conversation. XD
 <e>Romney</e> loves to say he ran & balanced the <a>budget<a> of the <a>Olympics</a>\, <e>Romney</e> got most of that $$ from the <a>federal govt</a>. #biggovtgettingthing ...
Basically if <e>Romney</e> is elected everyone can kiss their freedom goodbye _???
#Debate would be better if <e>Romney</e> & Obama wore top hats.

 Watchng Frank Luntz focus group. In his group\, vast majority of Obama supporters switching to <e>Romney</e>. #<a>debate</a>s
i cant understand how anyone could say that Mitt <e>Romney</e> won either <a>debate</a> wen we found EVERYTHING that he said to be lies and not plausible
 <e>Romney</e>: "The government doesn't create <a>jobs</a>." AND "If you elect me I'll create 12 million jobs." Which is it? Finkle is Einhorn! #<a>debate</a>s
@orangeinah Still think I'm voting for <e>Romney</e> now.
Keep in mind before these <a>debate</a>s started I wasn't too enthused with <e>Romney</e>. Also keep in mind they've been talking <a>economy</a>.
@Foster_Vann you sound like <e>Romney</e>? Atleast <e>Romney</e> talks in the <a>debate</a>s
 I got news for you. Obambie is Rich\, too.  Not as rich as #<e>Romney</e>\, because he can't manage his <a>money</a> wisely.  But still a multimillionaire.
 Obama's biggest moment\, in my mind\, was spelling out how much <e>Romney</e> will spend and that he can't pay for it without hitting the middle.
Lol the <a>Republicans</a> know <e>Romney</e> is #Losing but they're trying to be optimistic saying <e>Romney</e> did a good job
People who think Mitt <e>Romney</e> is completely cutting <a>financial aid</a> couldn't be more wrong..
#Debates Sorry MSNBC. Frank Luntz on @seanhannity undecided voter group HEAVILY for <e>Romney</e>. Vote changers. All said BHO defensive #tcot #p2
@seanhannity Obama as usual...talking puppet.  Rehearsed and could not stay on the question.  <e>Romney</e> has my vote!!Obama lied too many times
 "If ANYONE on ANY cable/broadcast network says Mitt<e>Romney</e> won this <a>debate</a> or thiswas a draw\, they are a flat outfool" ~ Rowland
Why Obama got a red tie and <e>Romney</e> a blue one?
No comment on the rumors that Bill Clinton has asked to borrow <e>Romney</e>'s <a>binders full of women</a>
 My fat thumbs were determined to type Romeny\, not <e>Romney</e>\, during that whole liveblog. They even did it just there...#<a>debate</a>s
 People don't like <e>Romney</e> or Obama for what they have done or said\, it all comes down to whose white and whose black.
@joerogan I think <e>Romney</e> is better because he's basically a used car salesman to me.
 #<e>Romney</e> labels <a>China</a> a "<a>currency manipulator</a>" - I would not bite the hand that feeds you. Great policy
@neo99934 @Mitt<e>Romney</e> @BarackObama Mitt <e>Romney</e> Just became PRESIDENT tonight!
A vast majority of Americans exploit <a>social welfare</a>. While I'm no <e>Romney</e> fan.. There is some truth to th <a>47%</a>.
 Debate results: Ladies and Gentlemen\, you will see a #<e>Romney</e>Ryan2012 #LandslideVictory  - Obama doubled down x 2 on <a>Libya</a> lies.
#Obama 11.8 Million Dollars net worth vs #<e>Romney</e> 250 Million Dollars  net worth. Now who's going waste Americas money.
 Sorry\, Candy Crowley\, that <e>Romney</e> was so rude to you. #TeamBarack #presidential<a>debate</a> #MittLies #<a>debate</a>2012
 If you look at how Obama and <e>Romney</e> act and communicate\, <e>Romney</e> is not someone you would want tobe friends w/. Not genuine or sincere at all
.@John_Ondo Bc I thought it was a draw. Have my rundown on my TL. Didn't think <e>Romney</e> did as well as the undecideds seem to. Great news!
 "... only voting for obama because he's black" then is it safe to say you're only voting for <e>Romney</e> because he's white?
 @Gibson_2012 But if you are voting for <e>Romney</e>\, what you supposedly are going to get are "<a>lowered taxes</a>."
Democrats say I love Obama and the republicans say I love <e>Romney</e>. And I'm sitting here saying I LOVE WINE!
My main problem w/ <e>Romney</e> is his plan to make all the <a>illegals leave</a>. Who is going to make all the tacos??? #FlawedPlan #Debates
Who do you think won the <a>debate</a>?<e>Romney</e> or Obama?
<e>Romney</e> clearly won that. Cant wait til this country is up and running again. #president<e>Romney</e>
Watched the <a>debate</a> for 5 minutes. Turned the station because <e>Romney</e> is annoying. I don't like either of them #voteforDonald #PresidentTrump
HILARIOUS: most of what <e>Romney</e> says is Obama's fault re <a>economy & budget</a> is actually the fault of <a>GOP administration </a>& <a>GOP Congress</a>
Obama won the <a>debate</a> but the umpire made some bad calls that hurt <e>Romney</e>
 Not unexpected\, though: panel said they were torn between <e>Romney</e> and not voting. Undecideds!
 The fact that people think I seriously like <e>Romney</e> SOLELY because I criticize Obama\, that let's me know people are blind
@Niloburgh <e>Romney</e> was talking about last year (attributed to Deep Water Horizon) and Obama was talking about whole term.
@jus_Bustine1173 Three for mitt <e>Romney</e> you go Mitt <e>Romney</e>! AND NONE FOR BARACK OBAMA.
@timothy_stanley - Don't you think that was <e>Romney</e>'s weakest point in the <a>debate</a>.  <e>Romney</e> should probably avoid all foreign policy to win.
 @BretBaier Very surprised by the Hannity focus groups reactions\, they were as adamant tonight that <e>Romney</e> won as they were last <a>debate</a>.
There is a big difference between living/going thru something and having others tell u about it.  <e>Romney</e> has no clue!!
 @gretawire <e>Romney</e> won\, he made his case\, he is the next president of the USA!
<e>Romney</e> should be president.
 <e>Romney</e> lied again\,sayin obama did not refer 2 d attack as an 'act of <a>terrorism</a>'\, which the <a>debate</a> moderator immediately confirmed to be tru
@ColcutKing and if you love <e>Romney</e> you will be a poor person who loves Obama. #circle
 <e>Romney</e> made a cheap shot remark about <a>God</a> the last 30 seconds to get Christian votes. Obama was rational\,  not cheap and crafty. Obama wins.
Ughhhh this election HAS GOT to be the most irritating!!!! I hate Obama and <e>Romney</e> is annoying too. I don't even feel like voting that's how
Mitt <e>Romney</e> could not put Candy Crowley in a <a>binder</a>. Ha! #<a>debate</a> #<a>debate</a>2
<e>Romney</e> just sounds so much nicer when he talks.
According to my Twitterfeed Obama did a lot better than <e>Romney</e> on the 2nd <a>debate</a>....Couldn't watch it because duty called :( #MidtermReview
<e>Romney</e> lost bad
@JoJoistheway <e>Romney</e> lied a lot.  Obama checked him. Both overtalked the moderator. Moderator fact checked <e>Romney</e>.  Obama won
<e>Romney</e> no where NEAR won the <a>debate</a>. He couldn't even answer one question with a straight answer.
I think they need to replace the <a>debate</a>s with fights. It would be amazing to see <e>Romney</e> and Obama go at it in a ring #seriously
 If your voting because of race\, remember that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican\, and Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s family Marched for <a>Civil Rights</a>.
 CSPAN caller: "I noticed how much of a flippity-jibbit <e>Romney</e> was being."
@finneyk <e>Romney</e> had a female Lieutenant Gov and more <a>females</a> on staff than any other governor. Your argument doesn't hold water. Or truth.
 <e>Romney</e> is terrible on stage\, just like Senator Marco Rubio from Florida.
Kanye West should've came & interrupted <e>Romney</e> in the <a>debate</a>.
@Brosig94 Wellll I mean Obama was avoiding <a>questions</a> just as much as <e>Romney</e> was??_ They both made fools of themselves imp :p #TeamTakeNoSides
I don't know about equal pay.<e>Romney</e>  went through <a>binders</a> full of women as if <a>qualified women</a> are so hard to find! <e>Romney</e>=Wrong for women
@jessiebear114 <e>Romney</e> did. But everyone else is gonna say Obama because they ignore the facts.
???@MadeaSimmons_: <e>Romney</e> disgust me! Talking about he care about <a>100 percent</a> of americans. Glad Obama mentioned that <a>47%</a> in his face!??²
Go <e>Romney</e>! Lets get the <a>economy</a> going again and get people to spend money!
 I don't like Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s platform or his speeches\, this <a>debate</a> is over.
 @allisonmak I tend to see a lot of reasoning "I hate obama\, he lied 4 years ago..." cool\, so what does <e>Romney</e> stand for that you think >
I just don't know <e>Romney</e> says he is going to do this and that but actually how what's your <a>plan</a> man give us a layout at less #TeamBarack
???@wheelingprobs: I think <e>Romney</e> and Obama should just drop the mitts and get it over with. #PresidentialDebate??²get them some helmets&gloves
@MelissaNagy1 @StephieT_31 yup i can believe it. <e>Romney</e> is a evil prick. Like the time he walked a blind professor into a door on purpose.

@drt_halfrican It would be pointless to vote otherwise tho b/c <e>Romney</e> and Obama have the majority of the votes.
Fox focus group significantly <a>showing</a> support for <e>Romney</e>
 "I appreciate <a>windjobs</a> in <a>Iowa</a>\," stands as the raunchiest thing Mitt <e>Romney</e> has ever said. #Debate
#obama lied about drilling for oil and smearing #<e>Romney</e> on Arizona law
@sourcefed #pdslive Obama won because his performance was so dramatically better and <e>Romney</e> was fact corrected mid-argument by moderator.
@cnnbrk <e>Romney</e> said <a>undocumented people</a> born/living in USA can serve in the military or gov. will make their life so difficult they'll leave
<e>Romney</e> said the <a>government doesn't create jobs</a>. Why is he talking about all the jobs he can create? #TeamBarack #<a>debate</a>

 @MagandaAkoAy so is there anything wrong being told that? People voting for <e>Romney</e> have the right to vote for whoever they want\, right?
@gretawire Loved <e>Romney</e>!  Proud of <e>Romney</e> for standing up to the <a>lies</a>. You go dude! http://t.co/TfRnCtdv
 Tonight's description of <e>Romney</e>- Snooty\, elite\, disrespectful\, entitled\, cheesy\, wrong\, insincere\, distant\, aloof\, exposed and dishonest.
<e>Romney</e> sealed it for Obama stumbling on <a>Libya</a>
 @MariahBaby218 Im not defending <e>Romney</e>. My rights are more important to me than money. Obama isnt a good pres\, hes just the lesser of2 evils
Heard President Obama and Mitt <e>Romney</e> do a lot of talking but nobody spoke about the problem of a bag of chips bieng 70% air and 30% chips.
 @dwas_0305 their feet & <e>Romney</e> being a "good man of God" should understand that & help those people too instead of try to take away things
 Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s lies are not the biggest problem\, it is our inability to listen to his truth.
 Did any feel that Obama made his case for the last four years? <e>Romney</e> is right\, we know better.
<e>Romney</e> put the smack down on Obama tonight again.
I think that both candidates showed up tonight. <e>Romney</e> delivered on <a>key issues</a> and Obama spoke passionately and won some points. #<a>debate</a>s
@joshtpm Candy did great too many times <e>Romney</e> get's away with lying to the nation about time he was called out with un-disputable evidence
@AndreaTantaros Wish <e>Romney</e> pursued those areas more vigorously. Candy's bias didn't help either.
Obama Played Mitt <e>Romney</e> The Whole Time Tho Obama Won The Debate .
 I'll be honest\, the only tidbit I've learned about either candidate is that <e>Romney</e> is a huge fan of The Killers. Now that's interesting.
So I think Obama needs to accept that he doesn't know how to run a country very well and that mitt <e>Romney</e> is the better candidate!!
All Obama does is put words into <e>Romney</e>'s mouthPretty sad #<a>debate</a>
My dad said he would vote for Mitt <e>Romney</e> rather than Obama.... #gross #getoutofmyface
 "Very little of what governor <e>Romney</e> just said is true" #themeofthe<a>debate</a>
Hannity playin Obama Words -<A>NO TERRORISM</a> mentioned-<e>Romney</e> was right
@echelondeutsch <e>Romney</e> stumbled tonight.. At least liberals and democrats can admit when Obama isn't on his game. Ugh furious!
<e>Romney</e> stated government cannot create jobs then in the same sentence he promised to creat <a>12 million jobs</a>...LMBO!!! #Idiot
@WilkowMajority @ToddFromMN I don't recall Obama ever winning a <a>debate</a> against <e>Romney</e>.
 Know your facts Mr. <e>Romney</e> before you bully "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation" http://t.co/m9x7FKiO
 "We just can't afford four more years like the past four years." -<e>Romney</e> #<e>Romney</e>Ryan2012
 Rachel Maddow is reporting that Republicans fled the post <a>debate</a> spin room...They went biblical on "fled " <e>Romney</e> did too! #maddow
@AndreaTantaros.  Don't you think it would help <e>Romney</e> if he would say I'm not for abortion being used as <a>birth control</a>.
1/2 Didn't like the response of Obama or <e>Romney</e> re <a>gun control</a>. 1500 American women murdered each year in <a>domestic violence</a>. #Debate2
Too bad the US is so big economically that Obama's colossal failure as president affects us all. #<e>Romney</e>2012
 "Obama is the iPhone 5 and <e>Romney</e> is a prepaid flip phone from Virgin Mobile."
 Without the mainstream media\, <e>Romney</e> would have been ahead long before the <a>debate</a>s.
<e>Romney</e> rules end of storyy
<a>God</a> is in control of everything!  I thank Him for the platform He has given me!  I respect everybody's opinion but <e>Romney</e> 2012!! #Godis1st
 & #<e>Romney</e> said NO <a>Taxcuts</a> 4 Rich\, just 4 middle-class. Again\, unlike what he's on the record saying he'd do! <a>20% tax cuts</a> 4 All\,NOTpossible!
 I give Obama an A+\, <e>Romney</e> an A-\, and Crowley an A.  I teach at a school with a lot of grade inflation. They all want letters of rec.
 If you prefer <e>Romney</e> over Obama\, please favorite this so I can Unfollow you.
How much R Koch Bros.  Adelson & ?? paying <e>Romney</e> & Ryan 2 destroy <a>middle class</a>?Could they help homeless with that money... Why not?

If Presidential Debate was a tennis match? 1st set was close; <e>Romney</e> won in a tie-break. 2nd set Obama bagels <e>Romney</e>. (6-0).
<e>Romney</e> Says he'll crack down on <a>China</a> and stop migrating manufacturing jobs to China! Really? America is made in China!!!
Mitt <e>Romney</e> and George Bush best friends.
Obamas say <e>Romney</e>Lies ... 0bama lies about everything.
 @IngrahamAngle Yes\, <e>Romney</e> blew that opening. Damn.
@ChuckLane1 Agree - and it might have been intentional. Every one has underestimated <e>Romney</e>! He didn't earn <a>$250M</a> by being a moron!
 Ugh\, the writers are totally setting it up for Obama and <e>Romney</e> to get together in the third <a>debate</a>. Get some new ideas\, Hollywood!
Ben thinks <e>Romney</e> is the lesser of the two evils.... _???_???

@Martin_Flood maybe you are right. I fear for the world if <e>Romney</e> wins. Then again..maybe he would be different in office.
@morningmika @JoeNBC #<e>Romney</e> doesn't <a>function</a> consistently

 <e>Obama</e>'s response to <e>Romney</e> when they were talking about <a>Libya</a> was genuine\,it was real\,it wasnt rehearsed.
<e>Romney</e>  <a>misleads America</a> when he speaks. #Team<e>Obama</e>

<e>Romney</e> is a <a>communist</a>.
<e>Romney</e> is the best at <a>vague promises</a>. #debate #debates #diabetes #typo
<e>Romney</e> justified  <a>paying women less</a> because his female Chief of Staff had to be home by 7 to cook clean and do the laundry.
<e>Romney</e> Looked Like A Fool Last Night And A Liar
 <e>Romney</e> seems like the perfect presidential candidate\, until he <a>speaks</a>.  #47%
<e>Romney</e> think we all can just go <a>ask our parents for 30k for college</a>. Not everyone was born rich like you
<e>Romney</e> you have no <a>business Running for President</a>! You are a Complete Charlatan !
 <e>Romney</e>\, Stop Lying! You don't care about me\, your <a>plans</a> have shown me that you don't give a damn about me or people that look like me
<e>Romney</e>...you can't continue to say that <a>something will work because it  worked in Massachusetts</a>. That state makes up 2% of the population.
<e>Romney</e>'s <a>first major victory</a> occurred on June 6th 1944 where he single handedly claimed the beach of Normandy.
<e>Romney</e>'s <a>five-point plan</a> is a one point plan. Like about everything.
 After watching the debate I was disappointed\,I thought <e>Romney</e> would  <a>explain more of his agenda</a>\,like McCain in 08\,acted like he was on uppers
all i hear is  <a>lies</a> from <e>Romney</e> #pleasestop
 As my grandma would say\, #<e>Romney</e> is more full of shit than a Christmas turkey. I'd like to suggest a few locations to store his #<a>BINDERS</a>.
Both <e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e> suck. But still <e>Obama</e>'s better in my opinion.
Can someone make a joke about how <e>Romney</e> *would* <a>put women in a bind</a>? I can't be bothered.
Dear Mitt <e>Romney</e>: please forward those <a>binders of women</a> along when you get a chance. Thanks much!
 Didn't your mother teach you it was rude to <a>interrupt</a>\, and point your finger in peoples faces Mr. <e>Romney</e> #Rudeashell
 Dude\, <e>Romney</e>/Ryan\, I respect you\, but damn\, you're not what we need. A shift in <a>political authority</a> is not ideal at this moment. #Paradigm
 During the debate\, <e>Romney</e> just <a>repeated himself</a>\, changed positions when it was convenient
 every time I see Mitt <e>Romney</e>\, all I can think of is Mitt and His Magic Pants. #pusamaterial
For some reason my tweets were sent today...whatever...<e>Romney</e> is the man that will  <a>lead America</a> and <a>bring jobs back</a>

 Honestly I do agree with <e>Romney</e> on the  <a>unwed parents</a>. It too kids having kids now in days. Too mutts\, smuts\, and nuts running round.
How can you support <e>Romney</e> when he is so  <a>anti-women's rights</a>?
I bet <e>Obama</e> has a #<a>binderfullofwomen</a> <e>Romney</e> certainly isnt the only one to have one!
I feel like if <e>Romney</e> win he gone <a>abuse his authority</a>
I guess I'm not in the top rich 1% because i don't have #<a>bindersfullofwomen</a>. I'll work hard in the next life to have <e>Romney</e> s binder
I prefer <e>Romney</e> though. <e>Obama</e> was talking things he had no idea about. How can you be talking about <a>budgets</a> based on what 'advisers' say?
I wonder why it's hard to take <e>Romney</e> seriously when he opposes <a>outsourcing</a>... #HofstraDebate #debates
 If <e>Romney</e> is elected\, I will finally be able to <a>make it home at a reasonable hour</a> to feed my husband and children a proper dinner.
If women are moving to <e>Romney</e> it could be due to churches pressuring votes on <a>social issues</a>. #p2 #justsayin
 If you jus look into <e>Romney</e> and Ryan's eyes\, they look <a>pure evil</a>
 If your a girl and have had sex\, don't vote for <e>Romney</e> because he is taking away all forms of <a>birth control</a>! You will become pregnant!#tards

My 17 year old son was <a>fact</a> checking Mitt <e>Romney</e> during the debate last night. Mitt definitely kept him busy.
My great objection to #<e>Romney</e> is his mistake belief that <a>insurance</a> is the only way to fund health care & we must be forced to buy insurance.
Not only that. But Mitt <e>Romney</e> is comfortable with <a>disrespecting the president</a>. The president is still the president.
 One thing is clear\, Mitt <e>Romney</e> prefers <a>binders full of women</a> more than binders full of facts.
So after have followed the 2nd #debate I would want Mr. Mitt <e>Romney</e> to <a>win</a> the presidential elections !#debate2012 #President #<e>Romney</e>
The only thing <e>Obama</e> could beat <e>Romney</e> at is  <a>golf</a>.
The truth finally comes out on <e>Romney</e>'s  <a>lies</a>#2012Debate
There is also a videotape of <e>Romney</e> saying how he plans to do nothing and by doing that the <a>economy</a> will better itself.   What an idiot.
Voting for <e>Romney</e> as a female student shows your true ignorance to what's going on.
 When Mitt <e>Romney</e> is president\, I hope one of the first things he does is <a>pass a law preventing Hollywood from making any more shitty movies</a>.
<a>Women</a> complain about everything. Even when allowed by <e>Romney</e> to <a>go home early</a> to cook dinner and get kids ready. Ingrates.
 Really\, the only things I don't like about <e>Romney</e> is his <a>view on gay rights and Planned Parenthood</>.

Ready for the election to be over. I don't need anymore time to come to the conclusion that <e>Romney</e> is ridiculous.
I'm convinced that 99% of <e>Romney</e> voters are voting for him because he's white.
Only reason i'd support #<e>Romney</e> is because we both got <a>binders</a> full of bitches. Hahahaha. #notreally

Mitt <e>Romney</e>'s <a>behaviour in discussion</a> is horrible :(
Which president you want? <e>Romney</e> will fuck us bottom to top and <e>Obama</e> will fuck us top to bottom. The question is who do you hate more?
@mantone1 All points <e>Romney</e> should have made.

@MattBatzel <e>Romney</e> got schooled last night!  <e>Romney</e> was so disrespectful.  Loved when Crowley called Mitt out on one of his MANY <a>lies</a>
 @TheFix I feel the same way about <e>Romney</e> <a>lies</a>\, but after all we are talking about the media doing their jobs. #AintGonnaHappen
This girl in my class said it was okay for <e>Romney</e> to <a>lie</a> because that's how you win an election and she is still voting for him -___- #Wtf
I am going to vote for <e>Romney</e>.
Maybe <e>Obama</e> represents good and <e>Romney</e> represents evil. And maybe the winner next month determines the fate of the world as we know it.
 After watching the full debate las night\, i didnt think <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> as bad as people been claiming. Theres def a huge bias on internet media.

If any <a>female</a> is voting for <e>Romney</e> you're an idiot... He's telling us we have no control over our body
Mitt <e>Romney</e> is a misogynist and his 18th century views on <a>women</a> make me sick. Any woman voting for him is in denial or has no self respect.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> has a "book filled with qualified <a>women</a>"... I think they call this a black book.  :)
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> will create tons of <a>jobs</a> for women. Mother\, wife\, cook\, maid\, boo-boo kisser\, sex-bot\, etc.
 <e>Romney</e> told 31 "myths" in 41 minutes - in other words\, he <a>lied</a> 31 times.
 <e>Romney</e> can't <a>pronounce</a> "legislation" and it annoys me.

@thehill <e>Romney</e> has no clue <a>what we want</a>. He is #binderfullofemptypages #debate #MittLies
 @aravosis I think the <a>binders</a> comment reflects <e>Romney</e>'s arrogance & self-centeredness: if it was done\, obviously he must have thought of it.
 <e>Romney</e> competent\, assured\, informed\, steady.
 "@blackenterprise: It's important to note <e>Romney</e>'s answer on <a>immigration</a> tonight greatly differs from his answer during the primary #debate"
 You all keep making fun of <e>Romney</e>\, but I don't see President <e>Obama</e> coming up with any ideas on how to efficiently <a>store women</a>
 Happy to live in a <e>Romney</e> <a>free</a> country\, although with his mentions of <a>"North America" and the pipeline</a>... #frightening

 I'm so jealous of <e>Romney</e>\, he has binders of <a>woman</a>\, and I have to settle for folders :(
 I wish someone had asked this last night: If the government cannot create <a>jobs</a>\, why does <e>Romney</e> think he can create 12 million? #debate2012
@Gramzy7 <e>Romney</e> was so perfect on <a>pointing out these facts</a>.
 A much better dig on <e>Romney</e> would be to point out that his response to <a>equal pay</a> was the gender equivalent to "Hey\, I have black friends"
 <e>Romney</e> do not know the <a>true meaning of "middle class"\, "poor"\, "struggle" etc</a>
I think that <e>Romney</e> showed how he doesn't respect <a>normal (middle class) people</a> by just putting up his hand and talks about what he wants!
Just watched Pres Debate #2 on Hulu and it looks like @Barack<e>Obama</e> punked <e>Romney</e> on numerous occasions. Lol
It's national Ass day?... I think Mit <e>Romney</e> needs to get his <a>contexts</a> right.
 On <a>women's issues</a>\, <e>Romney</e> doesn't just talk the talk\, he walks the walk. Just ask women who have worked for and with him.
 Reading highlights of the US presidential debate\, it's apparent one should wear a helmet while reading <a>anything said</a> by <e>Romney</e>. #facepalm

<e>Obama</e> went hard against <e>Romney</e>. It was like watching Big L battle rap against the situation.
 Mr. #<e>Romney</e>\, #<a>Mexicans / #Latinos</a> should not be referred to as #illegals. They are people with have #families just like you. #immigration
And he crushed the president on who would do a better job <a>handling our deficit</a>. Voters chose <e>Romney</e> on the issue by a margin of 59% to 36%.

 <e>Romney</e> seems like the kind of guy who still makes "<a>women</a> in the kitchen making sandwiches" jokes.
 <e>Romney</e> obviously doesn't even <a>watch the news</a>\, even during an election\, so he didn't know what the Pres said the day after Benghazi!
<e>Romney</e> will magically become conservative and stop <a>supporting what he has</a> for decades if he wins. #LoL
<e>Romney</e> is full of horse shit.
 @ladyblue49 I tweeted in the morning\, and your night during debate using #Venuspeak if you read\, I can prove <e>Romney</e> is weak in <a>Math</a> :-)
Every minute <e>Romney</e> and Ryan spend talking about <a>Libya</a> is time not spent talking about the <a>economy</a>.
@callumborchers joins us today for a debate fact-check of issues from <e>Romney</e>'s time as Governor to see if the <a>claims</a> from both sides add up.
@kf4yfa - I saw some of the replays and was so proud of <e>Romney</e> for standing his ground - I love it when a man stands up for his <a>beliefs</a>!!
If <e>Romney</e> was a <a>Christian</a> he'd be the perfect president but he's not... So... #sorrynotsorry
Watching that presidential debate again gave me a better understanding on why I dislike #<e>Romney</e>...I
#HistoricGhettoMoments #<e>Romney</e>'s<a>jobplan</a>: Employers make the rules and employees get screwed
There is NO presidential election story more newsworthy today than new #Gallup poll showing <e>Romney</e> up nationally 51-45. #election2012
 @navarrotells When interrupted\, you expect <e>Romney</e> to act like <e>Obama</e> did in the first debate? The moderator stepped out of line
@MartinBashir Of course <e>Romney</e> looked for <a>women</a> to work for him. He could pay them less and keep his payroll down.
 <e>Romney</e> why you so damn dumb\, I mean look at the <a>decisions</a> you want to make\, We might as well jump our asses back to the 1800's ! -____-
 @IngrahamAngle GALLUP: <e>Romney</e> 51%\, <e>Obama</e> 45%
Mitt <e>Romney</e> scored last night on both <a>substance and style</a>.
 Mitt <e>Romney</e> disgusts me. He's so rude\, and idiotic. I pray he isn't our future president.
And on the other side please explain to me why <e>Romney</e> would be a good president. Because I don't see anything that appeals to me at all.
What Planet  does Mitt <e>Romney</e> live on? Does He really think <a>cutting taxes for the wealthy</a> will create <a>Job growth</a>? is he a Mormon or a MORON?
USA would be in serious trouble if we somehow voted <e>Romney</e> into office. He is so short sighted just like most americans
 Mum mentioned Mitt <e>Romney</e> earlier\, I don't think I've hated someone has much as him\, just knowing that he's breathing annoys me. #Angry
@ElfandSlater Listen to the rose garden speech before you say <e>Romney</e> was corrected. He never called the <a>Benghazi attack</a> an act of terror.
<e>Romney</e> balanced the <a>Olympics budget</a> with $1B in government funding and donated <a>labor</a> by union workers. #Forward2012
 Look on the bright side\, if <e>Romney</e> wins\, maybe he'll start keeping his <a>money</a> in our banks.
Let me get political here Mr.<e>Romney</e> u can't bring the #<a>fuel prices</a> down but your rich ass homies could
The moderator had to interrupt <e>Romney</e> so much because he wouldn't <a>follow the format of the debate</a>.
 @Dominic_Calvano True! At least <e>Romney</e> kept the <a>lying</a> to a minimal\, didn't top his 27 lie record in the first debate.
 If there's one thing I learned from Mitt <e>Romney</e>\, it's that I need to store all my <a>women in binders</a>. Gotta tidy up around here.
Maybe if Governor <e>Romney</e> watched more Sesame Street his <a>math</a> would be better.
Herman Cain says <a>America will not negotiate with Moon Nazis</a>. Funny how <e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e> are so quiet about this important topic.
<e>Romney</e> looks like he <a>lies</a> to people to get more <a>money</a>
Can't wait to hear #<e>Romney</e> stumble through the <a>foreign policy</a> part of the debate next Monday.
That creepy <a>smirk</a> that <e>Romney</e>'s always got plastered on his face seriously creeps me out...
@michellemalkin I think we need some '<a>Women</a> for <e>Romney</e>' tee shirts made! #election 2012!
@GOP @Reince <e>Romney</e> has a plan to <a>strengthen all of America</a>. He has stated it time again. I don't know how any one is missing it.

 @jbarro  Though insistent that government can't create jobs\, <e>Romney</e> promises to create 12 million <a>jobs</a> as president
Do you think that people should continue to receive Government Assistance if <e>Romney</e> is elected? Please let me know your thoughts on this.

 Under <e>Romney</e>\, Massachusetts was 47th in <a>job creation</a>.
 To be fair\, <a>"Binders full of Women"</a> is a pretty weak gaffe to be harping on.  Plenty more substantive reasons not to vote for <e>Romney</e>.
 Remember: <e>Romney</e>'s Mormonism admonishes <a>women</a> only to work until she has children. Then quit work\, stay home to raise them #p2 #tcot #ocra
 @djoddsox You do realize that <e>Romney</e>'s <a>plan</a> is on his site\, right?

 @MadcapAnthony If you can't see <e>Romney</e>'s <a>success</a>\, then you don't want to see it. You will never see it.
@Barack<e>Obama</e> enough of the negativity and focus on <e>Romney</e>. Please focus on what your agenda is and how you will move the US forward
<e>Romney</e> really needs to stop <a>mentioning birds and death together</a> in any way shape or form. It's not helping him.
@notaxation Because of that mans <a>actions and comments</a> I will definitely vote <e>Romney</e>...some people...
I'd just like to point out that <e>Romney</e> wears more <a>hairspray</a> than most girls
 <e>Romney</e> is a "PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE" NOT the PRESIDENT\, & since all he does is <a>point fingers at the Current</a> he won't be the next
<e>Romney</e> has made some really good points in this debate.
<e>Romney</e> is just such a <a>liar</a>.. That's what ticks me off..

<e>Romney</e> don't <a>care</a> about me...Lyin ass
 @nmantineo <e>Romney</e> made some good points but didn't seem to <a>preform</a> well\, <e>Obama</e> looked better but still has no <a>substance</a>.
@alexwagner <e>Romney</e> just said Government doesnt create jobs. Then how is he gonna <a>create jobs</a> as President?
 "Some campaigns are more focused on <a>attacking</a> a person than stating what they prescribe" REALLY <e>Romney</e>... you did that this entire debate!
Strong <a>debate</a> by <e>Romney</e> again. Love it
I'm waiting for #<e>Romney</e> to <a>uppercut</a> #<e>Obama</e> #politics
@DatB0iAlex <e>Romney</e> believes in god
<e>Romney</e> has so many things to <a>brag about himself</a>. I wish he was more comfortable doing it.
Did he just say he was a pastor? #<e>Romney</e>.
<e>Romney</e> brings up the 47% elephant in the room by talking about his <a>passion</a> for the 100% of Americans #debate
<e>Romney</e> doesn't <a>care</a> about America. You will not get my vote #asshole<e>Romney</e>
 Excuse <e>Romney</e>\, he <a>talks</a> in the third person sometimes. #debate
Now that <e>Romney</e>'s talking about what we don't have to <a>settle for</a>... do we still have to settle for a third round of this? #debate2012
<e>Romney</e> and <e>Obama</e> did not shake after the debate.
<e>Romney</e> really is a dumb ass. He doesn't even want to <a>listen to</a> the president which means he won't listen to the idiots who vote for him.
<e>Romney</e> wins although <e>Obama</e> did show up tomight
<e>Romney</e> always having a family reunion on stage !!!
@iamashleymoran I think <e>Romney</e> is doin great
 <e>Obama</e> says investing in science and engineering bumps up <a>economy</a>. <e>Romney</e> dismissive: "government does not <a>create jobs</a>."
I'm voting for <e>Romney</e> mainly on one thing....his <a>faith</a> in GOD!! <e>Obama</e> didn't talk about his faith bc he can't bring up Allah to Americans!!
 #<e>Romney</e>: "I know what it takes to create jobs".  Really?  Then why did you kill so many by <a>bankrupting companies Bain purchased</a>?
<e>Romney</e> is planning to cut <a>Pell Grants</a>. So if you're in college and you vote for him. YOU'RE STUPID
No one wants <e>Romney</e>'s <a>signature</a>
#nbcpolitics <e>Romney</e> should have done more research on his <a>Libya remark</a>.
#<e>Obama</e> LOSES. No answers just more rhetoric. #<e>Romney</e> owned it.
I mean after that Libya question how can u believe anything Mitt <e>Romney</e> <a>promises</a>?
If <e>Romney</e> <a>is elected</a> I'm moving to Canada. #PeaceOut
#<e>Romney</e> is still in prep-school #latism
<e>Romney</e> mad as shit looking like a dirty lizard. He thought he was gonna <a>win</a> this debate
 It's to the point where if u vote for <e>Romney</e>\, ur voting for a <a>liar</a> that's uncertain of even his OWN word.
 @Salon_Politics <e>Romney</e> is 100% right. <a>The mention of acts of terror</a> was a general\, generic mention. It was not specific to Libya.
Y'all. They are saying this is a strong <a>debate</a> for <e>Romney</e>.
This debate wasn't as much of a blood bath as the last pres. <a>Debate</a> but definitely a big victory for <e>Romney</e>
I noticed some republicans are against <e>Romney</e>'s <a>policies</a> while ALL democrats are with <e>Obama</e> 100%.
 I just don't understand how <e>Romney</e>'s against <a>single parents</a> and also against <a>abortions</a>\, especially for those who've been raped. #logic
<e>Romney</e> sealed the deal tonight Great Job
I'm still shocked @ <e>Romney</e> <a>connecting gun violence to single parents</a>.
I will freak out if <e>Romney</e> <a>wins</a> the election
 <e>Romney</e> is just trying to <a>sugar coat things</a> ! Like NO \, just shut up !!!
 Summary of Debate: "I can <a>create jobs</a> if you make me the head of government\, which cannot make jobs." - Mitt <e>Romney</e> #debates
<e>Romney</e> is all <a>for the Rich</a>.
I don't care who wins they both suck <e>Romney</e> is an idiot and <e>Obama</e> has been in office 4 years an the only change has been more unemployment
Mitt <e>Romney</e> don't know what section 8 is so how he gone expect to <a>help the middle class</a>
@jeremyjojola <e>Romney</e> needs to <a>respect</a> moderators a little more.
 For 2 hours\, Gov. <e>Romney</e> briefly <a>answered questions</a>. Then\, <a>attacked</a> Pres. <e>Obama</e>. Lack of civility between the 2 but Pres. won this debate.
 Most disturbing comment by <e>Romney</e>: <a>that women in particular need "flexible work schedules."</a> Must say\, I am personally insulted.
The only good thing about <e>Romney</e> is that <a>his sons are good looking</a>.
 @nytimes If Mitt <e>Romney</e> is elected\, and he will be\, 100% of us will prosper because we will <a>have jobs</a>!!!!!
 Yeah <e>Romney</e> <a>BELIEVES</a> in God\, but that doesn't matter if he doesn't <a>ACT</a> like it. #dumbasses
 Governor <e>Romney</e> had data\, he just doesn't have the proper <a>solutions</a>.
Seems to be a bigger crowd around <e>Obama</e> than <e>Romney</e>. #debate2012
 <e>Romney</e> is officially unqualified for the job. If you don't think so\, please don't vote.
Mitt <e>Romney</e> IS A JOKE
Mitt <e>Romney</e> says government doesn't <a>create jobs</a> - why does he keep saying he'll create 12 million jobs??
I'm about to switch to Fox to hear how <e>Romney</e> did amazingly.
<e>Romney</e> has some explaining to do on <a>the outsourcing of US jobs</a>.... #Bain made him a millionaire.
God help this Country if <e>Romney</e> is  elected president
 NONONO <e>Romney</e> just <a>mentioned a god</a> in the debate\, that's never never never a good idea. Don't alienate people like that.
In 2011 <e>Romney</e> gave over 19% of his income to <a>charity</a>.
no one wants to take pictures with ann <e>Romney</e>... because she is ugly.
Bush and <e>Romney</e> are two totally different people.. Yes they are both republican that's it! <e>Romney</e> will <a>make a difference</a>! #truth
 Its not fair that <e>Romney</e> just <a>attacks</a> <e>Obama</e>'s failures\, at least he has the decency to <a>admit & apologize</a> for making mistakes
@zachelias96 @maxcreynolds Idk wht percentages everyone should pay..I just know a bit about <a>economics</a>. But I think <e>Romney</e> is the best option
muthafuckas are voting for <e>Romney</e> just because hes a <a>Republican</a> and they claim to be Republican.
<e>Romney</e>'s definition of <a>workplace equity for women</a> was letting them go home early enough to cook dinner. What an awful answer!!
@lovelyAirikahxX exactly. <e>Romney</e> would probably just <a>mess</a> it all up.
 What?! Now <e>Romney</e> wants <a>women to get home from work sooner</a> so they can make dinner? Boys can learn to cook too\, ya know!
For the record: I do not believe <e>Romney</e> could have stopped <a>the attacks in Libya</a> ... #vote
I'd rather have Bush in the office than <e>Romney</e>
@itsgabrielleu @Tyrese @johnlegend @aliciakeys  <e>Romney</e>'s Solution to <a>women's right</a> is to get women home earlier to cook dinner..
I wonder what Mitt #<e>Romney</e>'s <a>policies</a> will be next week #debate
How tf did <e>Romney</e> pass English in school? I know his <a>paragraphs</a> was naked as shit without the supporting details and only a topic sentence.
 If <e>Romney</e> doesn't <a>win</a>\, I'm moving to Mexico.
<e>Romney</e> should really make sure he knows what hes <a>talking</a> about ... Smh !
@donnabrazile That statements speaks volumes of how inept <e>Romney</e> would be as president.
 <e>Obama</e> actually has a plan to move us forward\, with <e>Romney</e> we would be stuck cause his only plan is the get rid of <e>Obama</e>!
@Lightskin_Pinky I have my reasons to like <e>Obama</e> ... I don't believe in the things <e>Romney</e> is trying to do
 President <e>Obama</e> should just put on some boxing gloves and box <e>Romney</e> LOL\, this debate was ridonks! #presidentialdebate
 "@lahoare: 2. <e>Romney</e> came off worse in the debate -- in fact\, he looked like a real jerk #debate"
<e>Romney</e> <a>wins</a> again! 
Mittens <e>Romney</e> is full of not knowing <a>the struggles of hard working people</a>

<e>Obama</e> made up from last debate and shut <e>Romney</e> DOWN!
 Honestly. If you are a #<a>woman</a> and you vote for #<e>Romney</e>\, you must be #INSANE. #backwardsSociety if it's #<e>Romney</e> in #November.
<e>Romney</e> made a definitely grave mistake on the <a>Benghazi issue</a>#msnbc2012
<e>Romney</e> don't <a>care</a> if we kill each other! #tf
 @RomneyResponse I thought Gov. <e>Romney</e> was terrific. He was not obnoxious\, he was respectful but exacting.  Pres did not tell the truth.
It's nice that <e>Romney</e> wants to make sure <a>women in the work force</a> can get home in time to make dinner.
@EvaLongoria I disagree.  <e>Romney</e> stood his ground and used <a>facts and numbers</a>. <e>Obama</e> used pure rhetoric and couldn't <a>defend</a> his record
@billmaher <e>Romney</e> buried himself by <a>trampling the female moderator</a> while saying he cares about women. The dissonance was striking.
<e>Romney</e> only <a>cares</a> about rich white people ..<e>Obama</e> cares about everyone surely the debate should be irrelevant even on these terms? #baffled
 <e>Romney</e> wants to <a>kick off some shit with other countries</a>. If he wins\, get ready for another World War soon after
@Jay_Severin <e>Romney</e> does well in the 2 on 1 format.
<e>Obama</e> has a lot of <a>commercials</a>... <e>Romney</e> has a lot of <a>lies</a>... 
<e>Romney</e> said he sat cross the table from people who lost their jobs. That's because he <a>fired</a> them
 @FoxNews  Go <e>Romney</e>\, next time go into more about <a>Lybia</a>!!!
This is not the last word on <a>Benghazi</a>. <e>Romney</e> must revisit this in the third debate.
I couldn't tell you what color <a>hair</a> <e>Romney</e> has if you asked. Or if he even has hair?
<e>Romney</e> looks like such a lying asshole
@AaliLadak most of America will believe it was pretty even. <e>Romney</e> definite wins in <a>economy and jobs</a> but <e>Obama</e> wins in the <a>environment</a> and..
Beautiful night for <e>Romney</e>!!  Looks good for <e>Romney</e> focus group favires <e>Romney</e>
If <e>Romney</e> <a>win</a> i really think there will be riots
 @tooshort35 <e>Obama</e> got rude\, too. His rudeness was a response to <e>Romney</e>s rude behavior. Still both men acted like children. Pathetic.
 <e>Romney</e> discussed how to <a>get jobs for women</a>\, but didn't actually answer the question about <a>getting equal pay/advancement for women</a>.  #Debates
 #morningjoe Binders full of women. <e>Romney</e> wants to talk about <a>affirmative action</a>\, but <a>dehumanizes them</a> in his expression.
 I wanted Mitt <e>Romney</e> to talk more of his <a>plan</a>\, then talking about how <e>Obama</e>s plan hasn't worked
 At this point\, it is clear that there is no cogent explaination for why anyone should <a>vote</a> for <e>Romney</e>.
I will be applying to McGill university in Montreal as an escape from America if <e>Romney</e> is somehow able to <a>win</a>
<e>Romney</e>'s <a>Tax plan</a> sounds very sketchy. Blueprint to income tax evasion?Great idea for the 47% and our mutual funds @barac @MSNBCRachel
I think <e>Romney</e> and <e>Obama</e> are in cahoots to keep Americans from <a>recognizing my royal authority</a>.
<e>Romney</e> making sure the <a>middle class</a> never loses their yachts....
 This debate should clearly help the american people make up their mind\, about who to vote for! <e>Romney</e> shown his truth self a <a>bully and liar</a>
#<e>Romney</e> did his best #VictorMeldrew <a>impression</a> tonight. #debate #UKView
Mitt <e>Romney</e> really all u can do is criticize what a real man is doing to <a>help the U.S</a>. get your head out your ass and get in the damn race

I have to say I was not to impressed with <e>Romney</e>'s <a>debate</a> tonight #whatwasthat
@JoJoistheway <e>Obama</e> came out stronger and was definitely the clear winner in this one. <e>Romney</e> was offensive to women. #PresidentialDebate
<e>Romney</e> will keep us <a>women in the binders</a>. #bindersfullofwomen.
TRUTH: #<e>Romney</e> has <a>policies</a> that are SUCCESSFUL! <e>Obama</e> has yet to prove any of his policies have even made a positive difference for America
<e>Romney</e> went toe to toe with the great <a>communicator</a>. Watch the polls.
<e>Romney</e> reminds me of the grinch for some reason.
 <e>Romney</e> shows class\, <e>Obama</e> shows his ass. #townhalldebate #debates
MT @KatyinIndy: RT this if you are sick of being lied to by <e>Romney</e> every time he <a>opens his mouth</a>! #debate
@TwitchyTeam <e>Romney</e> is. a Mormon not the <a>devil</a>
 "What's the biggest difference between you [Mr. <e>Romney</e>] and George W. Bush?" Good question!
 <e>Romney</e> did not answer the question about  <a>Lilly Ledbetter</a> that Prez signed on day 1 but he did have <a>a binder full of women</a>\, how demeaning!
Did anybody catch the fact that <e>Obama</e> did not <a>thank</a> anyone?  That was <e>Romney</e>'s first business.
 The best part of <e>Romney</e>'s <a>"close the loopholes" plan</a> is the cap on charitable deductions. Because charity is killing the economy. #debate
@DntFckWitWorks: : <e>Romney</e> not helping anybody but the <a>rich people</a>. Making the rich richer and the poor poorer!

 #<e>Romney</e> says his <a>tax plan</a> "adds up"\, but won't tell us the arithmetic. #faithbasedeconomics #debate2012
 The signature issue of this race is the <a>economy</a>\, and <e>Romney</e>'s just better on the subject. <e>Obama</e>'s record is what it is. #debate

@COURTNEYHALL_: <e>Romney</e> looks like he says nigger"all the time . Don't <a>trust</a> a guy with Grey sideburns just don't do it."
All Obama has to say to rebut <e>Romney</e> is...the <a>47%</a> video. What you say in secret is who you are.
!!!! RT @rolandsmartin: Mitt <e>Romney</e> says government doesn't create <a>jobs.</a> So why does he keep saying he will create 12 million jobs if POTUS?
Did <e>Romney</e> just pull the <a>religion</a> card? !
Assuming we are all "children of the same god" is ridiculously <a>naive\,</a> Mr. <e>Romney.</e> #townhall2012
<e>Romney</e> <a>sit</a> yo LYING ASS down!!
If <e>Romney</e> <a>Wins:</a> POOF Now You See Me. POOF Now You Don't
I Really Can't <a>stand</a> Mitt <e>Romney</e>
<e>Romney</e> has really <a>hairy</a> knuckles.
<e>Romney</e> is the <a>anti</a> <a>Christ...I'm</a> convinced then talkn bout he believe in God ain't nothing he doin Godly
Pastor??? Did <e>Romney</e> say he was somebody's <a>pastor?</a> #presidentialdebate
<e>Romney</e> believes in <a>God</a> _
Really? <e>Romney</e> was a <a>pastor?</a>
Mitt <e>Romney\,</e> how can you say that you care about 100% of Americans when\, on video\, you disregarded <a>47%</a> of them?
<e>Romney</e> was a <a>preacher</a> ? Smh
Is <e>Romney</e> <a>positioning</a> himself as the bailout guy? I don't think America wants a Bain-style bail-out. #debate
<a>Olympics</a> were saved by federal funding\, not <e>Romney</e>
<a>Do</a> you? Do you really <e>Romney?-Giahhn</e>
<e>Romney</e> cares about 100% - <a>47%.</a>
<e>Romney\,</e> please don't pull the <a>religion</a> card.
@tylera222 if I remember right\, it was <e>Romney</e> at the beginning if the debate who thanked the <a>moderator</a> for hosting the event\, Obama did not
<e>Romney</e> talking bout he care about us <a>kids</a> now. The last debate\, he didnt give a damn.
@TheLastWord @MittRomney Than how\, as President\, the HEAD of the gov't\, will <e>Romney</e> Create jobs\, if Gov't Can't create <a>jobs?</a>
Still cannot <a>believe</a> that a black man was actually elected as POTUS. That said\, Mitt <e>Romney</e> can't believe it either. #debate2012
@illytre25: Ok <e>Romney</e> idc what u <a>did</a> be4!!!!!!!!!!!
What is going on with time on this <e>debate??</e> 42 min Obama 38 Romney This is ridiculous! Better <a>equal</a> out at some point!
<e>Romney</e> forget he didn't care about that <a>47%</a>
@dbrew101 <e>Romney</e> is <a>boring!</a>
You were a pastor at your church\, Mr. <e>Romney?</e> THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A MORMON <a>PASTOR</a> MO FUCKER
Mitt <e>Romney</e> trying to mainstream LDS religion by saying he was a pastor. <a>LIAR!</a> His church does not have pastors\, only bishops
Not a <a>God</a> question and <e>Romney</e> mentioned God and I kind of nailed it but it's so much worse.
<e>Romney</e> that man didn't ask you about your damn <a>religion.</a> Answer the damn question.
Why would <e>Romney</e> say 100% when Obama hasn't mentioned the <a>47%?</a> I think I just saw a light bulb go on above Obama's head
I Believe we are all Children of the Same <a>God</a> #Mitt <e>Romney</e>
<e>Romney's</e> right\, we don't have to <a>settle.</a>

Very #debatable RT @theryersonian <e>#Romney:</e> I <a>care</a> about 100% of American ppl #debates
@mannyvay: #NBCPolitics <e>Romney</e> just said Goverment doesn't create <a>jobs.</a> Isn't that what he keeps saying he will do?????
<e>Romney</e> says the <a>college</a> <a>unemployment</a> rate sucks.... If you get elected\, I can't afford to even look at college. #allergiesflaring #stupidity
<e>Obama:</e> "I believe in everything Romney believes in. I believe in everything I believe in. <a>Believe</a> it."
<e>Romney</e> <a>pissin</a> me tf off ! *turns channel*
@CKokoros but <e>Romney</e> isn't a small biz guy... He's a <a>millionaire</a>
Mitt <e>Romney</e> <a>reminds</a> me of the guy in high school who only has friends because his parents have a swimming pool #debates #debate2012
What did <e>Romney</e> mean that "government doesn't create <a>jobs"</a> when all night he has preached that his 5 point plan will change employment rates
He just did ha RT "@nytjim: Obama doesn't mention 47 percent\, but <e>Romney</e> says he cares about <a>"100</a> percent of the American people""
<e>Romney:</e> Also in articles when you've stated "I'm not concerned with the really <a>poor."</a>
I love this man! He is smoking tonight! <e>Romney</e> is gonna have a <a>repeat</a> of tail tucking!Obama2012
#debates2012 <e>Romney</e> interrupting "Government doesn't create <a>jobs!"</a> a moment ago\,"If I become president\, I'll get America working again"
<e>Romney-</e> "I care about <a>100%</a> of Americans" Someone fact check that shit. #RomneyExposed #RealRomney
and the <a>47%</a> is out again! <e>#Romney</e> #2012Debate
He helped in 'getting the Olympics on track'?! #BitchPlease All <e>Romney</e> done was <a>criticize</a> #Liar
Lol <e>Romney</e> hating on obamacare but passed the same laws in his state. <a>Contradicting...</a>
In the end: Sound bite <a>wise\,</a> <e>Obama</e> has a number of Joe Bidens\, Romney has a few  Yellow Birds.
Mitt <e>Romney</e> and his entire campaign is about attacking Obama. You can't grow by pushing other folks down especially with <a>lies.</a>
<e>Romney</e> and Obama switched <a>tie</a> <a>colors</a> for this debate. #debate
<e>Romney</e> is <a>Mormon..</a> His view on God is NOT the same as yours\, promise.
<e>Romney</e> is a <a>strict</a> man \, but he has no <a>plan</a> .. That last answer about getting jobs back in the US contained a huge deal of fluff .
#debates <e>#Romney</e> wants us all to be <a>Mormons</a> and we will have charity to take care of the citizen. We don't need Government. #Ohio #Florida
If I could publicly <a>speak</a> as well as Obama amd <e>Romney</e> do\, I'd be so happy.   #ifonlyiknewwhattheyweretalkingabout
Last 2 minutes President. Guess <e>Romney</e> got less time. POTUS fair really? Oh he get's last 2 mins. for <a>47%</a> msm bias. #debate

Obama Get To The Point EveryTime <e>Romney</e> Be Trying To Add Stuff That Have <a>Nothing</a> To Do With America
Why won't <e>Romney</e> <a>mention</a> the word \, "Massachusetts?"
Mitt <e>Romney</e> hasn't been in <a>Government</a> but was Gov. of Mass?  How does that work?
Prediction:  FOX says <e>Romney</e> <a>won</a> this debate.  Every other channel says Obama won the debate.
Obama said he believe <e>Romney</e> is a good man and loves his family. Then he wanted to say\, BUT HE DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT <a>AMERICA!!!!!LOL</a>
<e>Romney</e> won't shut up about his precious <a>Olympics.</a> STFU. #RomneyExposed #ObamaWon
The last 4 years didn't work out like Obama promised\, it's time to move on and give Mitt <e>Romney</e> the <a>chance</a> to fix these mistakes #addebate2
Well I'm not even watching this debate bc I'm lazy af but I think <e>Romney</e> is an <a>asshole</a> based off of most tweets
<e>Romney</e> for <a>Bishop!</a>
the fact that <e>Romney</e> just brought up <a>God\,</a> not fearing what others will say >>> #RESPECT
Seems like <e>Romney</e> was focused on <a>bashing</a> the president while President <e>Obama</e> was focused on the <a>issues..</a>
Obama's first lie  'I believe <e>Romney</e> is a <a>good</a> man' you know he isn't. #debates

@schuellerj Like I said\, I don't think <e>Romney</e> relates well with the <a>public.</a> <e>Obama</e> had a <a>crutch</a> for a moderator.

<e>Romney:</e> Govt doesn't create <a>jobs.</a> But mine would. #debate #hypocrite
<e>Romney</e> kept talking bout dat <a>47%</a> tho lol

@edshow Obama won this hands down! He was superb and <e>Romney</e> just proved he is a bully\, rude\, and <a>wrong!</a>
Honestly <e>Romney</e> will do and say anything he can to get himself into office. He doesn't care about YOU or US. He cares about HIS <a>money.</a>
Lmao.. his salty ass RT @BONES_BONES: I think somebody from <e>china</e> fucked #Romney <a>wife</a> because he can't stand #china
My reach-across-the-aisle moment: <e>love</e> Ann Romney's nail <a>color!</a> #debates #Tiffanyblue
@LoniSwain Obama took that. <e>Romney</e> was helping setting up his own funeral. Romney needs to do his homework and <a>practice</a> his speech more.
Debat .. RT for Romney  <<< <e>fav</e> for <a>Obama</a> ..
<e>Romney</e> <a>cares</a> about 100% of Americans. He just doesn't consider anybody non-white\, non-straight\, or non-male an American.
Another 2 on 1 Debate tonite...same result <e>though...Romney/Ryan</e> <a>win</a> #Debates

<e>Romney\,</e> Get your <a>life</a> <a>together.</a>
I have a mild obsession with Ann Romney. I've already voted so now I'm <e>focusing</e> on the First <a>Lady.</a> #priorities
Romney wife <e>hair</e> is <a>dry</a>
All I need is a combination of <e>Romney</e> and <e>Obama</e> to <a>vote...</a> #undecided
Over all I think <e>Obama</e> came across more <a>genuine</a> than Romney it was brutal damn! #ThatWasDeep
Two parent families raising kids will help our kids have a better future. Parents need to raise their kids. (Great debate <a>point</a> <e>Romney)</e>
I'm 13 and I know that <e>Romney</e> and Obama are just <a>lying</a> to us! They don't even answer the real question that is being asked#ihatepolitics
Pretty sure <e>Romney</e> <a>contradicted</a> himself multiple times.. #nbcpolitics #PresidentialDebate @WilliamRHyde
@andrew_buelow <e>Romney</e> is a business man. He may not help <a>everything</a> but he will help the debt/economy
Clearly <e>Romney</e> doesn't know his own <a>plans</a> or <a>understand</a> what he's saying.
<e>Romney</e> throwing <a>god</a> in there..... they'll do anything for a vote
<e>Obama</e> baller and easily <a>won</a> tonight. Loved seeing Romney slip up\, this was another big turning point #Obama2012
I don't think <e>Romney</e> was as <a>terrible</a> as Obama was in the first debate. But it sure felt like he got <a>whupped.</a>
I don't know how <e>Obama</e> can keep from <a>punching</a> Romney in the face. same mom
@HunterMintz 1.Romney lies 2.Obama has reduced the national Debt (proven) 3.the 47% thing I only have three\, but <e>they</e> both had great <a>points.</a>
I WISH someone says <e>Romney</e> <a>won</a> tonight's debate....
Michelle Obama and Anne Romney are wearing the same exact color.  Let's debate <e>who</e> <a>wore</a> it better. #bitchstolemylook @e_FashionPolice
@KrystalBall1 i'm liking what I see. <e>Romney</e> has <a>doubled</a> back countless times on his own bs.
<e>Romney</e> is <a>RUDE</a> though if that was me up there I'd drop that mic and go karate chop that nigga in the throat
It makes me soooo mad when <e>Obama</e> <a>interupts</a> Romney. Punch him in the face Romney\, you could take him.
<e>Romney</e> will be just <a>like</a> <a>bush</a>
Is the reason Governor <e>Romney</e> keeps his <a>plans</a> a secret because theyre TOO good? -Obama #teamhonesty

My thing is <e>Michelle</e> Obama was <a>dressed</a> professionally . Mrs. <e>Romney</e> wants to walk out there with some gray nails .
@PattyBrat_ hell yeah! <e>Romney's</e> wife is <a>busted</a> as fuck! And she know she copied Michelle's pink fit!
<e>Romney</e> taking shots at <a>China</a> like they don't have missiles pointed at the US just waiting... stfu
If <e>Romney</e> was president\, he could do something <a>worse</a> than Obama but people would still say he did a <a>good</a> job
@AveryS2000 He did\, G! I disagree on Crowley tho! Alot of softballs to Romney she pitched! Great <a>debate</a> for <e>Obama.</e>
I honestly think <e>Romney</e> spent a few says hanging out with <a>Bush...</a> The dude was making no sense whatsoever... Lmao
They said <e>Obama</e> didn't <a>knock</a> Romney out this debate ....??Yes he did
<e>Romney</e> been talking about creating jobs to boost unemployment but said "government doesn't create <a>jobs"</a> #ImDone

<e>I</e> know nothing about politics but I just don't like Romney\, I have no reason I just don't <a>#blackpower</a>
If #Obama' s goal in tonights debate was to stem the tide of Romney's momentum\, then he failed. <e>#Obama</e> 's <a>actions</a> speak more than his words.
#Debates <e>Romney</e> made more <a>believable</a> arguments.
is <e>Romney</e> talking about raising <a>taxes</a> for? NIGGA\, we already paying $1.09 for a small ass bag of chips full of air... NIGGAA PLEASEEE! Lol
@ThatWhiteBoyCJ <e>Romney</e> has given millions to <a>charities\,</a> churches and schools also.
If <e>Romney</e> was such a great <a>governor\,</a> why do polls show Obama leading in Mass. by 19%?
<e>Romney</e> says he'll level the playing field between <a>China</a> and US because its fairer. He can't use the same tactic in class inequality at home?
@abcWNN <e>#Romney</e> <a>won</a> that #debate2012

Obama Should Just Call <e>Romney</e> A <a>Fuck</a> Boy Then Walk Off .

Im so afraid that Mitt <e>Romney</e> will <a>win.</a>
I'm a Republican <e>voting</e> for Mitt <a>Romney..</a> You lazy bitches is fucking up the economy!! -  @NickiMinaj
@PetCobra reminder: Mitt <e>Romney's</e> <e>father</e> <a>marched</a> with Martin Luther King for civil rights.
This man keeps going back on his word and <a>changing</a> them. He also needs to learn when to <a>shut</a> up. Oh <e>Romney</e> -.-'
<e>Romney</e> took his second <a>win</a> and Obama barely answered any Qs straight forward
<e>Romney</e> said he would eliminate  Capitol Gains <a>tax</a> for middle class!  I find that very important and exciting!
@nadine92 just checked 'em out. Glad to see a fair view.. <e>Romney</e> is simply inconsistent & a blatant <a>liar</a>
Just sarcastically asked Gillie who she was <e>voting</e> for. @The_chris_ryan quickly informed me she was voting for Mutt <a>Romney.</a> Well Done.
I may be a Canadian. You may think I'm an idiot\, but Mitt <e>Romney</e> is an <a>idiot.</a> It takes one to know one
When Mitt <e>Romney</e> <a>smiles\,</a> his eyes don't smile with him. He just has that face that says asshole. Weird.
@AFTunion You sound conflicted\, but I thought all things <e>Romney</e> are <a>bad...?</a>
Goodnight twitter\,  good <a>luck</a> to <e>Romney.</e>
<e>Romney's</e> <a>answers</a> are a bunch of malarky! @JoeBiden #MITTLIES #Debate2012 @OFA_NV
Mitt <e>Romney's</e> view on <a>Women</a> is what makes me like Obama more. #ObamaAllTheWay
<e>I</e> <a>like</a> <a>Romney</a> :-D
I don't think <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> poorly. I just think the President used what was available to him -- all the weight and power of the Presidency.
<e>Obama</e> pulled a "rope a dope" on Romney with the <a>Libya</a> comment! (confirmed?) #debates #HofstraDebate
Obama get's a little aggressive and passionate and he's perceived as being angry but <e>Romney</e> is blatantly <a>rude</a> and it's nothing. OH.
@Lis_Smith I agree Mrs smith. <e>Romney</e> will guarantee his major <a>taxes</a> will not go up but for us regular Americans he had no clear answers.
God will lead us in the way we want. Not the President. So I would rather vote for a Christian in Obama than a <a>Mormon</a> in <e>Romney.</e>
<e>Romney</e> Got Caught In So Many <a>Lies..!</a>
@Joi2TheeWorld <e>Anne</e> Romney looks like <a>death......</a> I want my First Lady not to look like the crypt keeper.
<e>Romney</e> what color is the sky?Romney: That's a very good <a>question.We</a> had a sky back when I was governor of Massachusetts.I like flowers.??
<e>Don't</e> see a single <a>Romney</a> <a>supporter</a> on my FB. Not a single one.
I <a>don't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Romney\,</e> but a part of me wants him to <a>win</a> just so that he realizes just how hard it is to make all these changes.
@JoeNBC Oh puhleeze Joe\, <e>Romney</e> was exposed for the <a>lying\,</a> hypocrite that he is and he got schooled on foreign policy.
<e>@BarackObama</e> <a>snuffed</a> Mitt Romney tonight #Forward2012
Obama= broken promises. <e>Romney=</e> evidence of <a>promises</a> fulfilled.#reliability #Romney2012

@OhAlex_: honestly both candidates have their faults but <e>Romney</e> truly <a>terrifies</a> me
Although would be fun watching <e>Romney</e> and The Donald <a>kickn</a> some china butt. #yaright
First thing I read on debate\, from Sullivan. God\, the relief. "To my mind\, <e>Obama</e> <a>dominated</a> Romney tonight in every single way."
<a>Stupid</a> <e>Romney</e> ugh only cares about money and power
This was a VERY testy debate. <e>Romney</e> played Biden card & interrupted frequently. Not sure it works when you're being <a>rude</a> to Pres though.
I love the fact checkers after the debate when they PROVE that all that shit <e>Romney</e> <a>talkin</a> is just that bull fuckin shit! No facts No plan
ppl be thinking that if <e>Romney</e> is our new president their gna have to be <a>mormon?</a> uh no! politics & religion are two different things.
So happy that Pres Obama pointed out the irresponsible opportunistic act of <e>Romney's</e> <a>statements</a> on the Libyan attack prematurely #CSPAN2012
<e>Romney</e> wanna <a>kill</a> <a>welfare</a> ... u kno how much of the USA is on welfare?
@cspan #cspan2012. <e>Romney</e> <a>won\,</a> BO improved over last time\, but not enough.
Honestly\, how can anybody support <e>Romney?</e>  The guy is a <a>liar</a> and a tool.
<e>Romney</e> is the <a>shit.</a> <e>Obama</e> <a>sucks..</a> #endofstory
<e>Romney</e> must have realized the iphone his wife got for him was a fake. Hence his anger with <a>China.</a>
So cbs also says people think <e>Romney</e> would create more <a>jobs\,</a> but that Obama "cares more about them" haha
<e>Romney\,</e> <a>please.</a> #2termZ #teamobama
<e>Obama</e> should of <a>threw</a> two cups of <a>vodka</a> in <a>Romneys</a> face..... _____

The <e>president</e> did <a>EXCELLENT.</a> I loved how he called out Romney on all his BS. Cindy was a great moderator but Republicans making excuses.
@vangeloco Republicans are generally quieter than dems by nature. At the end\, I said Obama won\, but I don't think <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> poorly.
Mitt <e>Romney</e> should instead give some <a>beauty</a> <a>tips</a> because he does not look 65

<e>Romney</e> appeared  more <a>truthful</a> than Obama....
When they discussed the debate on CNN\, they recapped some parts if it. My Mom put the volume down ever time <e>Romney</e> <a>spoke.</a> She's done.

<e>Obama</e> dominated Romney tonight in every single way: in substance\, manner\, style\, and personal appeal. http://t.co/jLboxf25 #pwned
@Barack<e>Obama</e> President Obama showed his strength tonight. A lot of factually facts were stated from the President. Great job!!!!
If you dont want to vote for <e>Obama</e> for other reasons\, fine\, but dont act like he could have supermanned the economy in four years
I love how <e>Romney </e>supporters spin <e>Obama</e> as brash and rude tonight\, but when Romney was assertive in the 1st debate\, he was a hero. Grow up!
<e>Obama</e> kept saying "thats just not true"....What my president really wanted to say was "nigga thats some bull shit"
<e>Obama</e>didn't kill bin laden. One of my brother in arms did. He just happened to be president. <e>Obama</e> didn't find him soliders did
This was not just Obama doing what he had to do. This was <e>Obama</e> throwing down a double-pump slam dunk launched from 3 point land. #debate
<e>Obama</e><a> lied. Here's the fact check on his promised "changes" </a>as per 2008. http://t.co/bbmtFRZK #HofstraDebate #FightForJobs
<e>Obama</e> save the best for last. The 47 percent!!!!
Game\, set and match to<e>Obama</e>. He got it; he fought back; he gave us all more than ample reason to carry on the fight.  http://t.co/jLboxf25
Both are credible presidents&amp;fine men-tough choice-immigration\,taxes\,reproductive rights will decide.<e>Obama</e> much better but<e> Romney </e>solid too
<e>Obama</e> was on his A GAME tonight\, clear winner! #Obama2012 __
<e>Obama</e> is just a terrorist... #justkidding #probablyisthough #killedambassador #seeyaobama _
<e>Obama</e> saves "47%" for the last two minute so that<e> Romney </e>couldn't respond. #crafty #debate
AND if I hear ONE more person say "<e>Obama</e> killed Osama" I'm gonna lose my mind.. REAL heroes killed him\, NOT <e>Obama</e>. Get your facts straight
Landslide victory for <e>Obama</e>. We saw one President for all Americans on that stage tonight\, <e>Obama</e>. #Forward
<e>Obama</e> killed <e>Romney</e>on the closing statement.
President<e>Obama</e>struggled for weeks to offer a consistent story about the terrorist strike in Benghazi. #Debates #CantAfford4More
I do have to admit that<e>Obama</e> shoved a plate of shit down<e>Romney</e>'s throat with that 47% comment.  #MITTSCOUNTRYCLUBMOMENT
<e>Obama</e> Was Tyson In His Prime Tonight
President <e>Obama</e> took on the bully. I substance\, demeanor\, and debate style he was far more effective than Mr. <e>Romney.</e> No doubt a good night.
<e>Obama</e> won--the whole thing\, but especially the last question. #debate
Once again\,<e>Obama</e>spoke longer than Romney\, but<e>Romney </e>used more words than <e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> <a>doubles down on his cover up</a>. I love it.
<e>Obama</e>really stood up for Latin people\, Hispanic and children of illegal aliens.  <e>Mitt </e>made it clear you got to go!
It is panic time in Obamaville. Internals have to be showing <e>Romney </e>up 6-10. This is Reagan-Carter redux. #tcot #teaparty #p2
<e>Obama</e> better than last time\, but again\, @<e>MittRomney</e> wins. Good night. #debate
<e>Obama</e> needs to learn<a> how to speak about the question that is asked and to answer the question</a>. Not repeat shit that isnt needed.
<e>Obama</e> dominated that debate...
The fact that this debate will be recapped by Libya is not great for <e>Obama</e>.
Why is <e>Obama</e> so critical of success? It's like he views success as being bad. <e>Romney</e>'s pension being too long\, really? #HofstraDebate
<e>Obama</e> definitely secured the illegal immigrant vote.
Hurray! The <e>pres</e> we know is back! He made<e> Romney </e>look weak on facts and ideas.  We are better off than 4 yrs ago mustn't go back to GOP pols
<e>Obama</e> drones on and says nothing
UNINSTALLING <e>Obama</e>..... ___________________ 87% complete @<e>MittRomney</e> #tcot
<e>Obama</e> gave more guns to Mexican drug cartels than he did the consulate staff in Benghazi\, so there's that.
Tonight <e>Barack</e> showed\, as he has every day as president\, that he?ll fight to ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream. ?mo
You can combine the speaking skills of Churchill\, Reagan\, and Lincoln\, and President <e>Obama</e> could still not defend his own record.
Weird\, <e>Obama</e> came across as bitter and clingy. #jerk
<e>Obama</e> would be more convincing if he weren't the incumbent. He keeps talking like he just started last month.
<e>Obama</e> says "I'm gonna do this this and this" but why hasn't he done it yet? What happened to doing that these past 4 years? #stepup #Debates
My take on <e>Obama</e> tonight: "There is <a>nothing worse than aggressive stupidity</a>."- von Goethe
Big\, Angry<e>Obama</e> just came off as <a>unnatural\, uneasy and uncomfortable</a>. I think it made him look sour and mean. #debates
So just to be clear.  #<e>Obama</e> loves Planned Parenthood\, #<e>Romney </e>loves families.  Just to be clear.
Listening to tonight's contraception exchange\, I think<e>Obama</e> understands my patients' needs better than<e> Romney</e>. #debatehealth
Maybe I missed it\, but did President<e>Obama</e> go another full debate without outlining his plan for next four years? #debate
President <e>Obama</e> 100% - Very\, very obvious.  "Binders of women"? - I don't think so!
We're a little off-topic\, here. --<e>Obama</e> when he got caught with Chinese investments.
So the government doesn't create jobs\, but it's <e>Obama</e>'s <a>fault</a> for not creating jobs?
If you can not beat them\, then<a> lie</a> lie lie to the American people and hope they are to stupid to fact check and care. #<e>Obama</e>
Me voting for <e>Obama</e> would be like me running my head into a wall\, over and over and over and over!
I find it revealing few people even comment on\, much less get troubled by\, <e>Obama</e> talking about "<a>hunting people down</a>" like he's a T-1000
I really would like to tweet my opinion on the debate tonight but I don't think I could fit it into 140 characters how ridiculous <e>Obama</e> is.
<e>Obama</e> is an idiot.... and that's all I have to say about that. #Votefor<e>Romney</e>2012
If <e>Obama</e> is here... who's running hell? #SHFL
<e>Obama</e>killed it tonight. Absolutely killed it. If i believed any of it I would vote for him. But such an improvement.
_ President<e>Obama</e> is <a>controlling this debate completely</a>. This is remarkable to be seeing this. #nbcpolitics #History _
<e>Obama</e>'s eyes back up the meaning of what he says.<e> Romney</e>'s eyes betray him at every word.
<e>Obama</e>promised so much last time and didn't do anything so Im confused as to why everyone believes him this time.
<e>Obama</e> put more border patrol agents on border.... then gave Mexican drug cartels guns to shoot them with.
<e>Obama</e> is what we need for a <a>steady\, permanent improvement in our country</a>. Y'all already know who I'll be voting for. #fuckmitt #Obama2012
<e>Obama</e> has had 4 YEARS and all he has done is drive our country into a hole. Look at the shape America is in. What else do you need? #<e>Romney</e>
What<e> Romney </e>and everyone else needs to realize is that <e>Obama</e> is just one person. He can't fix 8 years of damage by himself.
Let's be clear: <e>Obama</e>is no <a>great friend to immigrants and brown people </a>around the world. #debate
Our <a>economy has raised 17% in the last four years</a>\,<e>Obama</e> made something out of nothing
I truthfully can't stand listening to <e>Obama</e>.. He hasn't done anything to get us out of debt so why the heck  would you vote for him
<e>Obama</e> got more<a> immigrants out of here </a>than any other president.
If <e>Obama</e>were an ice-cream flavor\, it would probably taste like bad decisions.__
My mom was a single mom <e>Obama</e> that doesn't make you a female in the workplace
Eeeewwww <e>Obama</e>'s fingers are so long...
I think <e>Obama</e> has a blinking problem. #presidentialdebate2012
<e>Obama</e> is by far the better choice\, I honestly believe both of them aren't all that great but we're better off with<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e>'s administration deported more illegal immigrants than any other administration before him. What is <e>Romney </e>talking about?
<e>Obama</e> should pay attention.  Had to ask name again.  Really?
<e>Obama</e>stop taking bin ladins credit. The cia and bush admin has been working on it for years and all you do is say "shoot him" @FoxNews
Yes <e>Obama</e> you have done everything that you can...WHICH HAS BEEN NOTHING!!!
<e>Obama</e> is LITERALLY choking!!
<e>Obama</e> deported my grandma
<e>Obama</e> had to attack <e>Mitt </e>because he doesn't have a record to run on! He's not pro the American dream\, he was part of the communist party??
Never thought I'd say this but I really hope <e>Obama</e> gets reelected
I'm a firm believer of<e>Obama</e>'s slogan. We need to CHANGE the current president.
Q. How can<e>Obama</e> improve the economy? A. Lose the election.
<e>Obama</e> dropped the ball on the Benghazi attack. Fact
<e>Obama</e><a> did awesome tonight</a>! I live my president! Great job! #obamabiden2012 four more years! ___
President<e>Obama</e> im proud of you :) you are more fit to run this country and me and my family are supporting you 100 percent! @BarackObama
<e>Obama</e>\, I applaud u sir. U never backed down. U were on point and defiant.<e> Romney </e>didnt phase u\, u phased him Great job Mr President. #Debate
<e>Obama</e> was certainly more awake and combative this time around\, but not really any new ground covered. Also<e> Romney </e>lied\, like\, a lot.
I salute <e>Obama</e> he don't just care the rich folks...he support the poor as well...unlike<e>Romney</e>
<e>Obama</e>'s closing was far better than<e> Romney</e>'s. #debate #Debate2012 #CNNDebate
President <e>Obama</e> brought it home  #fourmoreyears
<e>Obama</e> really wants us to have an education :)
I like how <e>Obama</e> did exactly what <e>Romney </e>said he does\, concentrate on bashing Romney and not tell about his actual policies!
<e>Obama</e> won this one on style\, substance\, facts and character!
This is My President. Mr. President <e>Obama</e>. This is the man that has done all he can to get this country back on track. Let's give him 4 more
<e>Obama</e> you had four years and shit has not changed like it was said to. So therefor you don't deserve another four.
This time I was much more impressed with<e>Obama</e>'s performance. And<e>Romney </e>just supported my opinion that he's wrong for America in this era.
<e>Obama</e>\, notice how<e>Romney </e>actually ANSWERS the questions. You should try that. (; #yourstoriesareirrelevant #quitrepeatingyourself
<e>Obama</e> Cant run on his record due to the fact of<a> all the failures</a>
Wow... Is Everyone really going to be fooled by <e>Obama</e> again?? What good has he done for us in the last 4 years..
Meanwhile <e>Obama</e>sounded very confident telling a bunch of <a>bald-faced lies</a>. #debate
I love how<e>Obama</e> tried to get the subject changed after <e>Romney </e>pointed out that<e>Obama</e>called Libya a terror attack the next day. Haha. Liar!
When<e>Obama</e><a> didn't say anything about God</a>\, that really bothered me...
SherriEShepherd loved that President<e>Obama</e> ended with the 47% comment. Very effective.
first\,<e>Obama</e>- I hate to tell you this\, but you had nothing to do with killing Osama Bin Laden!
<e>Obama</e> takes way to much credit for killing Osama Bin Laden. I'm pretty sure that was the navy seals.
Not even close. A complete reversal from the first debate\, <e>Obama</e> winning on every level.<a> Audience connection\, emotional appeals\, facts</a>.
Did <e>Obama</e> even do anything his last term that actually benefited America sufficiently?
Huge performance from <e>Obama</e> tonight\, a clear victory -- <e>Romney </e>was agitated and unpresidential. #TeamBarack

<e>Romney</e> is <a>too busy worrying</a> about what <e>Obama</e> did and didn't do.. What about YOU ?

I can't even count the number of time I've screamed at<e>Obama</e> on my TV #Debates
What America needs is another @birchallday vs. Zach Moore <a>economic debate</a>.  Craig can be<e>Obama</e> and Zach can interrupt him the whole time.
I wonder how many<a> biology/health care majors</a> are fans of <e>Obama</e> care\, not I
We Need To Create <a>Jobs</a>.... Yes<e>Obama</e> and you had 4yrs...... SOOOOooo #MyParty12

Shut Up And Let<e>Obama</e> Speak
No sense<e>Obama</e> because <e>Obama</e> has <a>no idea to run a business</a>. Maybe if he had worked at McDonalds he would have a clue.
@seanhannity glad the Buck stopped with<e>Obama</e>. Unfortunately <e>Obama</e>'s playing golf\, or on vacation.
FACT:<e>Obama</e> in rose garden didn't refer to <a>Benghazi</a> as <a>terrorist attack</a> or act of terror. But thanks 4 playing Crowley-"http://t.co/BGW5lD0J
#<e>Obama</e> doin it for the <a>Asia</a>

@tiffphilippou much better debate. Debating's the winner. And <e>Obama</e>. Great joke about pension size
I just don't like the way <e>Obama</e> <a>talks</a>. #cocky
<e>Obama</e>'s hand when he's talking >>>
Loves how <e>Romney</e> won't let <e>Obama</e> <a>talk</a>!#Debates
I'm voting for #<e>Obama</e> again for him to finish what he started!  he's the best we got.
<e>Obama</e>'s hair is LAID right now. I wonder if he sleeps with a <a>durag</a> on?
@SoulRebelxx Just drinking some aloe vera juice and listening to Uncle <e>Obama</e>
@Landonsmith21  <a>don't hate</a>! <e>Obama</e> 2012!
That look <e>Romney</e> gives when looking at <e>Obama</e> it's like he's got hearts on his eyes #MyThoughts #debate
The major difference in this debate: <e>Obama</e> is elaborating on <a>his plans</a>\, whether they are put into action in the future or not
<e>Obama</e> wants us to <a>create</a> the next Apple. Like. A pear I figure.
From shovel ready to high wage high skill? You couldn't do shovel ready <e>Obama</e>\, how are YOU gonna go high wage high skill? #lnyhbt #Debate
<e>Obama</e> is<a> for the people</a>..<e>Romney</e> is not
why is this<e> lady</e> favoriting <e>Obama</e> so much\, your supposed to be on both sides remember #retard
<e>Romney</e> first to address 47% comment\,<a> baiting </a><e>Obama</e>
I said it last week. To win\, <e>Obama</e> had to attack <a><e>Romney</e>'s personality and ethics</a> and expound on his plans for the future. #GoodJob
Candy\, some <a>jobs </a>aren't going to come back.... #<e>Obama</e> #Debate2\, it's bc the <a>wages</a> are too low for American ppl\, High Wages is our goal
Hollywood loves <e>Obama</e> smh
<e>Obama</e> finally said it straight: "Some <a>jobs</a> are not coming back."
<e>Obama</e> needs to get outa here.
???@RealJayMillionz: If <e>Obama</e> DON'T win\, we gone be posting tweets *via cotton field*???
-->. RT @ExJon: <e>Obama</e>: "There are some <a>jobs</a> that aren't gonna come back!" Put it in an ad\, Mitt! #debate
<e>Romney</e> be looking at <e>Obama</e> like he wanna kill him.
Ok <e>Obama</e> please mention the <a>47%</a> now!..
Aaand <e>Romney</e> indirectly addresses <a>47%</a> before <e>Obama</e> brings it up.
@my3monkees AMEN!!!!  LOVE <e>Romney</e>!  I can listen to him give \,<a> SPEECHES </a>for the next 8 YEARS!  <e>Obama</e> - I'm tired of listening to him <a>whine</a>!
???@Shaw_Kinnadi: i honestly would trade Clinton for <e>Obama</e>" Everyone just forgot about his whole scandal where he lied to the congress smh
We all children of the same God? Well my God told me <e>Obama</e> is the way to go...now what?
<e>Romney</e>\, too bad you didn't have a<a> tough</a> life like <e>Obama</e>\, meaning you dont have<a>experience</a>.
I'm <a>proud</a> to call <e>Obama</e> my president #<e>Obama</e>2012
@Monte_na I honestly think <e>Obama</e> will win tho
I still laugh at the fact that <e>Obama</e> referred to a "child" as a 21 year old the last<a> debate</a>.
I praise <e>Obama</e> 4admitting some <a>jobs</a> can't b brought 2 US. <e>Romney</e> is off his rocker if he thinks we can compete w/overseas <a>iphone production</a>.
President <e>Obama</e> HAS my <a>VOTE</a> <e>Romney</e> is SO damn lost cnt imagine him running this <a>country</a>!!!
Set the <a>people<a> straight <e>Obama</e>!
<e>Obama</e> claims <a>"low skill" jobs</a> belong overseas??_shows his real lack of concern as it regards having ALL Americans being able to<a> WORK</a>
<e>Obama</e> should say I want <a>world peace</a> and drop the mic!
@jaronjones That exchange was a complete embarrassment for <e>Obama</e>.  He had nothing to say in his defense.
<e>Obama</e> literally just said some jobs aren't coming back and that he doesn't want <a>low-skill jobs</a>. High-skilled industry can't <a>employ </a>everyone.
@tjholmes That <a>case</a> can't be made..<e>Obama</e> 60 <e>Romney</e> 35\, and gotta give Candy a High Five (she was subperb)
<e>Obama</e> better make these <a>2 minutes count</a>
<e>Obama</e> "When I was president..." Anyone else caught that? Lmfao.
<a>Jobs</a> are not the answer? WOW mr <e>Obama</e>
#<a>Free enterprise systems</a>...#<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> vs <e>Romney</e> reminds me of @therock vs john cena :-/
<e>Romney</e> just said all the <a>campaigns</a> just attack him but that's definitely what he did to <e>Obama</e>. No one's falling for your<a> deception</a>.
#debates <e>Obama</e> believes our <a>tax </a>$ is his to give to his highest contributors!
@current i think <e>Romney</e> is going to ruin our<a> country</a> if he wins .#Team<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e>: <a>Self-reliance</a>\, but you didn't build that.
#debate ....<e>Obama</e> just murdered <a><e>Romney</e>'s selling point</a>. #STRATEGIC A F
Now <e>Obama</e> comes with the big lie.  He believes in <a>risk taking</a>\,<a> self reliance</a>\, etc?  Oh come on.  First time I've heard him say it.
@Talkmaster  Heck\, after tonight <e>Obama</e> may<a> vote</a> for <e>Romney</e>!
Gees! <e>Obama</e> LOVES<a> free enterprise system</a>. Who would have thought.
Told y'all <e>Obama</e> was gon turn up tonight.
I love when <e>Romney</e> is talking and <e>Obama</e> gets up\, you know things are about to go down. #debates
<e>Obama</e>: I want it to be <a>equal opportunity</a> for people to go to college. @MaxineAllstar: yeeeaaah not for the WHIIITE KIDS. *le funny accent*

What a <a>complete tool</a> <e>Obama</e> is.
Yeah <e>Obama</e> won this <a>debate</a> for sure.
Wow. <e>Obama</e>'s not even answering the question and its about HIM! #Debate
Yes! <e>Obama</e> attacked <a><e>Romney</e>'s quote</a> about the<a> 47% of Americans</a>. #F
<e>Obama</e>.. <a>Checkmate</a>.
<a> 47% reference</a> <e>Obama</e> applause by blue crowd </a>at #afropunkdebate viewing #debatebk
Playing by the rules is how the <a>economy grows.</a> - #<e>Obama</e> #debate
I'm telling you <e>Obama</e> is <a>illuminate</a>
Mitt gets 2 minutes and <e>Obama</e> gets at least 4!! #Cheater
cannot believe <e>Obama</e> just brought up the <a>47%</a> thing.
Given how many people think <e>Obama</e> is a communist/socialist\, him saying that the <a> free market</a> is great IS countering a misconception.
So awkward seeing Duran argue with James about <e>Obama</e> on fb right now.. LOL
<e> <e>Obama</e></e> just said he believes in <a>self-reliance</a>. That's 100% against all of his <a>policies</a>. He wants people to rely on the<a> government</a>.
<e>Obama</e> on <a>jobs</a>: <e>Romney</e> has <a>'1-point plan'</a> - http://t.co/7BU0Y8Uy
<e>Obama</e> finally brings up the <a>47% </a>zinger! Save the bet point for last! #CNNDebate #democrat #<e>Obama</e>2012 @Barack<e>Obama</e>
<a> Class warfare</a> is all <e><e>Obama</e> <e> has to run on. #2012debate #CantAfford4More
@harryandximena <a>Are you kidding me</a> ! I hate <e>Obama</e> !!
<e>Obama</e> just crushed <e>Romney</e>.... He just gave <e>Romney</e> that work
Lol. <e>Obama</e>'s <a>closing statement</a>...heh! #Emotive #Factual #ByeBye<e>Romney</e>
Good job <e>Obama</e>! He finally <a>called <e>Romney</e> out</a> on that \,a>47%</a>. #TeamBarack
Where were all the <e>Obama</e> supporters after the<a> last debate?</a>!
FINAL<a> SCORE</a>: <e>Obama</e> 1\, <e>Romney</e> 1. #debate #debate2012
Is it possible to believe in <a>capitalism</a> while bring a socialist? That's what #<e>Obama</e> just said he wants us to believe. #debates
<--- Voting for <e>Obama</e>.
Amennnnn !!!!  #<e>Obama</e>
President <e>Obama</e> you <a>got my vote</a> #debates
No doubt that <e>Obama</e> talks a better game. But the  both suck. The whole <a>system</a> sucks. Can I vote for a<a> new government</a>?
I'm I the only one that sees similarities between <e>Obama</e> and @TheRock ?
This final <e>Obama</e> hit on the <a>47 percent comment</a> is his best punch so far. Strong finish for <e>Obama</e>. #debates
Go on <e>Obama</e> slug them down @Barack<e>Obama</e> he knows what its all about <e>Romney</e> is a tool and can't spell matt #mitt lol
Awesome <a>closing remarks </a>for Pres. <e>Obama</e>
@TheLastWord @Barack<e>Obama</e>  I wish President <e>Obama</e> would have brought up the fact that the Republicans want to get rid of <a>minimum wage</a>.
You just had to know that <e>Obama</e> would close with a <a>47% jab</a>.
<e>Obama</e> <a>talks</a> so slow...
<a> Time</a> <e>Romney</e> 40:40 to <e>Obama</e> 44:04\, more differential than the full time of one question.  Not impressed.  #debates
<e>Obama</e> jus shut him down!!!!
<e>Obama</e> passed up so many <a> job offers</a> that could have made him as rich or richer then <e>Romney</e>. But he cared bout the <a>country</a> and went for prez
FINALLY! <e>Obama</e> calls <e>Romney</e> out on his <a>47% comment </a>that denigrates<a> honest\, diligent people</a>. #thankyou #debate
<e>Obama</e> is a nice person.
Both sides will claim <a>victory</a>...<e>Obama</e> did better than <e>Romney</e> though...
I'm all for <e>Obama</e>. That's all i'm saying about this political crap.
<e>Obama</e> WON!!!!!!!!!!!! Yay!!! #Team<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> just uppercutted <e>Romney</e> like the bus driver did that girl with that 47% finish.
@eddiegossage think <e>Obama</e> won on the <a>closing statement</a> alone.
for people who prefer the <a>sports analogies</a> : <e>Obama</e> was sitting on the <a>47% fastball</a>.
<e>Obama</e>: <e>Romney</e> hates<a> veterans</a>\, vote for me. #ComeOnMan#STOP
@JamesTHarris Can't stand to hear <e>Obama</e>'s voice anymore. Lies lies lies!!!!
<e>Obama</e> definitely brought his<a> A game tonight!</a> Good job\, Mr. president!
<e>Obama</e> came out guns blazing! I believe he won this <a>debate</a>.
At least <e>Romney</e> admitted his <a>faith</a> and <e>Obama</e> didn't go near it. #debates
Absolutely... RT @foreveryagirl I think #<e>Obama</e> did a much better job in this <a>debate</a> vs the last one #<e>Obama</e>2012
<a>Debate</a> was good until <e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e> stopped getting in each others' faces. #debates
#<e>Obama</e> saves the best for last. Brings up <a>47% remark</a> at the end of the <a>debate</a>. Last thing everyone hears. He slams #MittTheTwit! #debate2012
Yeah <e>Obama</e> never called it a terrorist attack in the rose garden. Called it an "attack" that's pretty broad Barack
I love the love the <e>Obama</e>'s <a>show</a> for each other _??«
Mitt <e>Romney</e> just tries to answer  <a>questions</a> by attacking <e>Obama</e> & having wrong<a> facts</a>. #ohokay
I really though <e>Obama</e> and Mitt was gonna beef son
Yes\, first lady Michelle <e>Obama</e> is always <a>on point</a>.
???@blakeburkett: If <e>Obama</e> is re-elected\, I'm going to purchase my first gun.  End of story.  #<e>Romney</e>Ryan2012??? Amen!
<e>Obama</e>!!
<e>Obama</e> <a>spoke</a> more than 3 minutes longer than <e>Romney</e> tonight #debates
<e>Obama</e> OR DIE !!  HE JUST<a> TOOK</a> THAT <a>DEBATE</a>!! #Team<e>Obama</e>
@SuzBrockmann I feel like that was just a game of Mortal Kombat\, and when <e>Obama</e> said 47% the words "finish him" came on my screen.
<e>Obama</e> vs <e>Romney</e>- <e>Obama</e>!
@billmaher <e>Obama</e> murderer <e>Romney</e>!
<a>Close debate</a>\, but I think <e>Obama</e> took it.
<e>Romney</e> dismantled <e>Obama</e>. Simple as that. #<e>Romney</e>2012
This was a great <a>debate</a>! Good job <e>Obama</e>!
<e>Romney</e> crushes <e>Obama</e> again.  #debates ...I'm done.
Now that's the assertiveness I <a>want to see</a> from President <e>Obama</e>.
President #<e>Obama</e> was better\, he was more specific\, confident. MSNBC it might be easily considered <e>Obama</e>'s best <a>debate</a> performance.
Hempstead brought out the aggression in <e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> isn't that great but he's def better then Mitt here lol
Clear <a>victory</a> for President <e>Obama</e>
Number one reason I hate <e>Obama</e>? Because <a>killing</a> a child should never be legal\, even if you consider it just a 'group of cells'.
@DakodawithaD: Man. I'm amazed how much of a liar\, fake and moron <e>Obama</e> is. He has really <a>outdone himself</a>. #debates  #<e>Romney</e>ftw
<e>Romney</e>\, you were pwned #team<e>Obama</e>
Clear <a>victory</a> for Pres <e>Obama</e> to this debate. :) _?_?_?__
<e>Obama</e> went for the kill tonight
<e>Obama</e> calls <e>Romney</e> a liar throughout both <a>debates</a>\, yet finishes the<a> debate</a> with "<e>Romney</e> is a great man."#Fake
@RI4A Very clear that <e>Obama</e> will persuade an <a>Inmigration </a>support. <e>Romney</e> won't support any <a>inmigration</> plataform in benefits of inmigrants.
To me who won the <a>debate </a>is #<e>Obama</e> yall already know don't care what nobody say
You did it <e>Obama</e>! You beat that disrespectful piece of garbage called Mitt <e>Romney</e>. C'mon <e>Obama</e>\, let's get that! 4 More Years! #Debates
Wow\, <e>Obama</e> did <a>phenomenally</a>.
its funny because my entire family is like super republican and im just like\, "ehh. <e>Romney</e>'s ok. <e>Obama</e>'s ok. I don't actually care."
<e>Obama</e> did lie about the <a>Arizona immigration model</a> success reference though.
Bring jobs back! :O #<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> was a force of nature on this <a>debate</a>
One\,<a> mistake </a>compared to 20 million <e>Obama</e> has already made!
<e>Obama</e> won tonight
This time I was much more impressed with <e>Obama</e>'s<a> performance</a>. And <e>Romney</e> just supported my <a>opinion </a>that he's wrong for America in this era.
You have got to be kidding.<a> Decisive</a> win for <e>Obama</e>???????
@komonews #debates both did well\, but <e>Obama</e> was <a>solid</a>!
If <a>convicted felons</a> could vote it would be ah #LandSlide for <e>Obama</e>.. #TruuuStory
Just because I don't vote for <e>Obama</e> doesn't make me<a> racist</a>. The fact that you vote for him because he's black kinda does.
Of course <e>Obama</e> ends with 47% when he knows <e>Romney</e> can't counter...who cares that it was completely off the question...typical #debate
Lmao that 47% was <e>Obama</e> at the spades table wit <e>Romney</e> all jokers have been played <e>Obama</e> slams the big down and walks away wit game and set
And <a>debate number 2</a> goes to Barack <e>Obama</e>! #4MoreYears
<e>Obama</e> won this <a>debate</a>. He was in total control.
@MBalabayeva I'm not... But I think <e>Romney</e> did very well considering the <a>moderator</a> seemed to lean more toward <e>Obama</e>.
<e>Romney</e>\, You've been Handled!!! <e>Obama</e> hit him for six with the<a> 47% comment</a>! Take that <e>Romney</e>  #<e>Obama</e>4president #2012presidentialdebate
<e>Obama</e> believes in fairness\, not ingenuity and hardwork.
These reporters talking like <e>Romney</e> was neck 2 neck with <e>Obama</e> in this <a>debate</a>. Was they watching the same debate we did. <e>Obama</e> smashed dude
<e>Obama</e> definitely did better\, and <e>Romney</e> is still doing strong. But<a> both</a> of them just seemed <a>average</a>. #debate
If <a>democracy</a> represents little more than a WWE Slam\, then President <e>Obama</e> played the<a> role</a> of the Big Boss Man #Debate2012
You can say <e>Obama</e> is all talk and no play but his views are for the greatest <a>middle class</a> via <a>education</a>. He is better for america #<e>Obama</e>2012
People who are for <e>Romney</e> are going to say <e>Romney</e> won and people who are for <e>Obama</e> are going to say <e>Obama</e> won.
I give <e>Obama</e> a pat on the back for his \,a>patience</a>.#NBCpolitics
<e>Obama</e> is Like Kobe in the 4th quarter.
Looking at the first <a>debate</a>\, <e>Obama</e> looks like the nice guy who???s been pushed too far. #debate
<a>Vote</a> <e>Obama</e> or don't vote ! #RS
<e>Obama</e> hit that 47%! Tell em! #<a>Team<e>Obama</e></a>
@Greytdog @kate_sheppard @DavidCornDC  I don't think anyone cares about the<a>47%</a>\, everyone cares about what <e>Obama</e> didn't do :P
Why did <e>Obama</e> have a talking time 3 minutes longer than <e>Romney</e>'s? #CNNdebate
@gretawire Mitt won due to his extensive knowledge and <a>numbers debate</a>\, and <e>Obama</e> was on the defensive\, but not trying to show it.

Don't blame that on <e>Obama</e> \, he's trying to create <a>more jobs</a> but you can't do that in four years
@TheDaleJackson I think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> slighly\, but not for substance. He delivered his rhetoric & lies very well.
<e>Romney</e> was intimidated\, made invalid points. <e>Obama</e> genuinely cares about the<a> American people</a>. <e>Romney</e> cares for the wealthy.
@silkysmooth1812 I was always an <e>Obama</e> supported. Was willing to give <e>Romney</e> his shot to win me and he didn't
@FoxCT <e>Romney</e> 1- <e>Obama</e> 336 . Not even close.
I don't look at my <a>pension</a>; it's not as big as yours #Debate #<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e>..More<a> poised\, fluid</a>\, <a>natural</a>. Achieved what he needed to. Good work.
I believe <e>Obama</e> just got his next 4 years.
#<e>Romney</e> keeps saying he knows how to create <a>jobs</a> but never says exactly how he will do it. He's a con man. Nothing more. #<e>Obama</e>
<e>Romney</e> is too worried about watt <e>Obama</e> is doin INSTEAD of saying watt he is trying to do #CSPAN2012
Y'all make a<a> mockery</a> of <e>Obama</e>\, but hate <e>Romney</e>\, y'all care about politics but make everything a joke.... K
<e>Obama</e> functioned much <a>better</a> at sea level.
Is the reason Governor <e>Romney</e> keeps his <a>plans</a> a secret because theyre TOO good? -<e>Obama</e> #teamhonesty
@sallykohn Only in your warped little mind. Sorry\, <e>Romney</e> clearly won tonight despite the witch candy Crowley defending <e>Obama</e>.

<e>Obama</e>: I want to close <a>loopholes</a> that allow companies to move jobs <a>offshore</a>. <e>Romney</e> wants to expand those tax breaks. http://t.co/NZHuiqNX
American People? 0. Little specificity\, too much squabbling. We need more a>substance</a> in our politics says this commentator and <e>Obama</e> voter.
A clear <a>win</a> for #<e>Obama</e>. #HofstaDebate #PMTDebate
People who don't like <e>Obama</e> because he's black are ignorant #justsaying
It is safe to say that <e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e> do not like each other\, at all.
<e>Obama</e> hit <e>Romney</e> with that <a>47% </a>thing perfectly. I loved it.
@alwaysBEhaven\, <e>Obama</e> destroyed him.
@imanil0l <e>Obama</e> can get it
This round was for <e>Obama</e>
MSM won't concede <e>Obama</e> <a>victory</a>. #debate
I thought <e>Obama</e> had style points. <e>Romney</e> wasn't as smooth but had more substance. <e>Obama</e> couldn't refute his dismal record. #tcot
I dont give a damn what anyone says in 4 years all <e>Obama</e> has changed is the gas prices and not in a good way #N<e>Obama</e>2012

@alec_meyers he is a master of taking things out of context. Still don't see reason to give <e>Obama</e> his job back. He's had 4 yrs.

@ccoffman12 I thought they were going to straight up fight at one point. <e>Obama</e> would obviously win that. #StreetCred
From what I'm seeing yet again <e>Obama</e> is the Devil and <e>Romney</e> is Satan. #Politics.
Seems to be a bigger crowd around <e>Obama</e> than <e>Romney</e>. #debate2012
the only good point <e>Romney</e> couldve made tonight is that <e>Obama</e> be winning be trying to sweet talk the <a>women</a> of America.
Like seriously\, all of you guys are flipping out about Mormons\, black guys\, <e>Romney</e>\, <e>Obama</e>\, debates. And I'm over here with some eggo waffles

In case you didn't know <e>Obama</e>. People usuaally don't get second chances when they mess up the first one!! #N<e>Obama</e> #debate2012
@ChrisPatrick_3 ...and all <e>Obama</e> can say is that he promises to fix what he hasn't the last 4 years... He had an opportunity and failed
@iamdiddy <e>Obama</e> who you think?
You really. Think it is stupid to <a>vote </a>for <e>Romney</e>? How stupid is it to <a>vote</a> for <e>Obama</e> the second time after the damage he's causes
@DuPageLink: Debate: <e>Obama</e> accuses <e>Romney</e> of<a> favoring the rich</a> http://t.co/I5lepohA #DuPage #news

<e>Obama</e> sent how many Billions to Brazil to drill oil off their shore.Oh wasn't G Soros a major investor in that company!
This as <e>Romney</e> at his best - equal to that of his first debate performance - and he lost to <e>Obama</e>.
The only reply that <e>Obama</e> has had to the last 4 years of <a>debt</a> increasing 6 trillion dollars is "Mitt <e>Romney</e> is rich!". #CantHideFromFacts
AMEN!!!!!!!  RT @HarryLarris: Bottom line. <e>Obama</e> lied about the Rose Garden comments.  So did Candy Crowley. Shameful. #tcot
Yes\, we know <e>Obama</e> exposed <e>Romney</e>
<e>Obama</e> Has A Clean Line Up Tho.
<e>Romney</e>: Mr. President Have you looked at your <a>pension</a>. <e>Obama</e>: No I don't look at my pension it's not as big as your's.
Eghh. As an objective viewer\, gotta give the edge to <e>Obama</e>. No way this was a draw.
<e>Obama</e> got too much <a>confidence</a> Mitten
<e>Obama</e> is a good president <e>Romney</e>s a Mormon from planetkolak -_-
Ooooog I missed that! Apparently <e>Obama</e> & <e>Romney</e> didn't shake hands post- #<s>debate</a>
<e>Obama</e> should look in the camera and say : look me in my face "I ain't got no worries! " !
<e>Obama</e> didn't save the <a>47%</a> for the last minute\, <e>Romney</e> set his damn self up with his last remark about caring for 100%!
Words for words...points by points...President <e>Obama</e> explained\, corrected or just shuttled the door on.... BRAVO\, MR. PRESIDENT!...
I'm tired of everybody talking bout the first <a>debate</a> <e>Obama</e> did what was suppose to be done he studied his opponent  #BeatIt
Why would you ask <e>Obama</e>s campaign manager about her opinion? Shes obviously gonna defend <e>Obama</e>
???@AnnCoulter: will love to see O in the unemployment line. <e>Obama</e> clinging to his job and paycheck.???
I don't see the need to bash either of the candidates If you don't like <e>Obama</e> don't vote for him easy as that No need for all the negativity
my vote is for Barack <e>Obama</e>
<e>Romney</e>'s strongest points: Critiquing <e>Obama</e>'s 1st 4 yrs\, on creating jobs\, energy plan
<e>Obama</e> was more agressive this time tho.... I give him that.
@CarolineManzo me either but people are calling for <e>Obama</e> as the winner...
@KalebDaniel305 <e>Obama</e> can keep <a>talking</a> and you can KEEP listening but all I hear is rhetoric.
@centsiblelife <e>Obama</e>\, hands down
@airPLane20 <e>Obama</e> was\, but he isnt the cause of the <a>recession</a>. and the <a>recession</a> caused the giant spike in <a>unemployment</a>

I'm not big on <e>Obama</e> or <e>Romney</e> but I'm willing to give <e>Obama</e> another 4 years & <e>Romney</e> doesn't offer enough solutions 2 win my <a>vote</a>
If <e>Obama</e> was to <a>debate</a> <e>Romney</e> and not say a word my twitter time line would be blowing up saying <e>Obama</e> killed Mitt! #givemeabreak
@ThisWeekABC  yes this is <e>Obama</e> <a>victory</a>
<e>Obama</e> got in the <a>47%</a> AS THE LAST WORD.  Yay!
<e>Obama</e> had 44 <a>minutes</a> vs only 40 for <e>Romney</e>
The left admits defeat\, the right can never do that\, <e>Obama</e> won tonight\, and Biden won last week
<e>Obama</e> referenced the glass ceiling. Mah man.
I think it's safe to say <e>Obama</e> #slayed
Although Mittens was highly successful with his statements regarding women and Bush\, <e>Obama</e>'s trenchant and erudite tone enabled his <a>victory</a>.
<e>Romney</e> cheap shot @ <e>Obama</e> bringing up his <a>extensive experience with small businesses</a> and making <e>Obama</e> talk about his failures. #debate
<e>Obama</e> dominated the <a>debate</a>. Nice to see he is back :) #<e>Obama</e> #CNNDebate
<e>Obama</e> <a>debated</a> better tonight\, but was that enough? No.
<e>Obama</e> won
I think <e>Obama</e> came on strong tonight
Ur a goofy RT @realDonaldTrump: <e>Obama</e> better than last time\, but again\, @Mitt<e>Romney</e> wins. Good night. #debate
Instead of talking about what President <e>Obama</e> didn't do talk about what he did do. He had to come clean up the big mess President Bush
wish audience had asked <e>Obama</e> why he did not do all the things he continues to <a>pledge</a> to do if given 4 yrs
C'mon\, @arifleischer. We both know #<e>Obama</e> didn't talk ab his plans because HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY. #debate #cnn
According to survey of undecided voters at #debate\, <e>Obama</e> won: 37% <e>Obama</e> 30% <e>Romney</e> 33% tie @CBSNews
<e>Obama</e>: 44 mins <e>Romney</e>: 40 mins #debates
I'm all for mitt and Ryan but <e>Obama</e> did good... The polls have the say in who won
And yet <e>Obama</e> complained about the <a>time</a>\, thinking that he was getting less.  I didn't hear <e>Romney</e> complain about getting 4 mins. less.
@mehdirhasan he probably believes that <e>Obama</e> doesn't believe in the same god as he does or that <e>Obama</e> is a Muslim.
@xoxo_MonaeLove Again he helped FIX that<a> economy</a> after <e>Obama</e> let the entire Nations economy crash and led to all state economies crashing
CBS poll: 37% say <e>Obama</e> won; 30% say <e>Romney</e>. But 65% say <e>Romney</e> would be better on the <a>economy</a>\, the top issue. So pretty much a push.
Too bad third parties don't win in America. I don't like <e>Obama</e> or <e>Romney</e>\, honestly. But we all know <e>Romney</e> is gonna win Texas.
The <a> debate</a> was GREAT!!!!!!   The President did an outstanding job.  Mitt is full of LIES!!!  President <e>Obama</e> was right on point!!!
#<e>Obama</e> went over time. The host said time was up. His reply "this is important" IT'S also important 2 follow the rules #presidentialdebate
@jedlewison CNN doing their best to ignore own uncommitted focus group bc realtime line clearly favored <e>Obama</e>. Trying to paint <e>Romney</e> win.
Basically\, <e>Obama</e> Exposed <e>Romney</e> successfully in this debate.
The truth squad #<e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> >>>>>
Every time I see someone say "name one thing <e>Obama</e> did" my response will be "lol bin laden"

???@GadsdenRattlers: <e>Obama</e> looked desperate tonight. He knows he is losing in the polls. #<a>debates</a>???We'll see Mitt's surge continue.
Just<a> vote</a> <e>Obama</e> if you think he's gonna help you or vice versa for <e>Romney</e>. Shit we're all selfish af anyway myself included
<e>Obama</e> won the <a>debate</a> decisively. http://t.co/c9mCQT56
<e>Obama</e> won.How do I know?The <a>republicans</a> are complaining that <e>Obama</e> had more time to speak\, fact\, but shows republicans know <e>Romney</e> lost
What I find odd though is how quickly everyone now wants to assert that <e>Obama</e> is not perfect...as if <e>Romney</e> is perfect.
<e>Obama</e> sure tries to make himself look better by lying.. He needs to try a lot harder.! #2012PresidentialDebate
They let <e>Romney</e> go over just like <e>Obama</e>\, I guess that's fair. #shrug

@KatieeB_ people who think <e>Obama</e>'s <a>health care ideas </a>are a good thing need a nice slap across the back of the head........... With a shovel.

So <e>Obama</e> in the last <a>debate</a> got it handed to him:-)  he actually tried this time and I'd still give the edge to <e>Romney</e> #gomitt
Watched the <a>debate</a>\, obviously. I find <e>Obama</e>'s energy policy laughable when earlier he said he planned to increase energy prices.
@haidang_nguyen its going to take <e>Obama</e> longer than 4 years to fix what bush screwed up.

Why do people think things are gonna get better if <e>Obama</e> is re-elected? It will be the exact same as the last 4 years. I don't understand.
<e>Obama</e> or <a>civil war</a>
Read the transcript. RNC chair accuses <e>Obama</e> of lying about Libya and moderator "aided and abetted."
So why does <e>Obama</e> get props for bin laden\, but doesn't get held responsible for <a>unemployment</a>\, he inherited both\, be fair I'm that
My whole <a>twitter feed</a> is bashing on <e>Romney</e>. #iloveyouguys #Team<e>Obama</e>

@Janae928 so does that mean <e>Obama</e> should have <a>overseas accounts</a> he hits <e>Romney</e> for. Sounds hippo critical
That was fun!! I wish I had some snacks tho. Vodka flowing and fearing for the morning. <e>Obama</e> is back\, Spain is in the clear\, Greece is TOST
<e>Obama</e> believes in<a> free enterprise\, self reliance\, individual initiative</a> and rewarding risk takers... and then he said BUT. #contradictions
As I predicted <a>Democrats</a> would say <e>Obama</e> won overwhelmingly. I am shocked Democrats would say their candidate won.
#<e>Obama</e> wants to reinstate <a>"assault weapons"</a> ban. I'm glad that's on the record. #guncontrol
@JustCeeC: President <e>Obama</e> should have dropped the mic and wall off stage after that last answer! I'd drop the mic for him. Lol

<e>Romney</e> just got roasted. Deny it all you want \,<a>republicans</a>\, but a monkey could judge that <e>Obama</e> won #debate2012
@neaboo89 the problems <e>Obama</e> didn't create
<e>Obama</e> strong\, so is <e>Romney</e> in second <a>debate</a> http://t.co/BFQ4G2XI
<e>Obama</e> has appeared weak and tired in several recent public forums. I wonder if he actually even wants to be president anymore...
<e>Obama</e> <a>talked</a> louder\, but didn't tell us what he would differently than he is already doing. Talked a lot\,but said nothing. An empty suit.
It's funny how these retired senators that are republicans are<a> endorsing</a> <e>Obama</e>
I only wish <e>Obama</e> would have shown this vigor during the last <a>debate</a>! #Debate2012
Both <e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e> both didn't answer questions. Both didnt say how they are going to improve the <a>economy<a>. Man .....Just vote for me !!!!
<e>Obama</e> keeps my hope alive in good men.
Binder-women & "My pension is not as large as yours" will be the 2 memorable quotes from tonight's #<a>debate</a>. It's a draw edging toward <e>Obama</e>.
<e>Romney</e> did just as well as the last <a>debate</a>\, and <e>Obama</e> did much better.  <e>Romney</e> spoke sense\, and <e>Obama</e> avoided defending his record with lies
Lol RT @Prettii_Caramel: Lamborghini Mercy\, Republicans So Thirsty\,Rommney On The Stage Thinking <e>Obama</e> Bout To Hurt Me #Swerve

@iowahawkblog Seriously. ABC News described <e>Obama</e>'s attacks as on "<e>Romney</e>'s record"!? Who's the president again?
I'm literally surprised that <e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e> didn't start swinging at each other. They sure looked like they wanted to... #<a>debate2012</a>
Everybody says <e>Obama</e> won on Libya. While <e>Romney</e> blew his <a>answer/opportunity</a>\, did <e>Obama</e> ever actually answer the question?
???@iAmKingDuy: J Cole\, Lupe Fiasco\, and Kendrick Lamar not voting for <e>Obama</e>. Enough said.???They are voting for <e>Romney</e>? _??_
President <e>Obama</e> was concise and to the point. Round 2 goes to him.
<e>Obama</e>'s a champ
Why would you <a>vote </a><e>Obama</e>? He lied about the deaths of 4 Americans overseas over national tv!da fuck
@iRoqueKurls my coworker are going in on president <e>Obama</e>... I wish I could show you what some if them are thinking...
MSM is basically saying that <e>Obama</e> won this one because he wasn't as lousy as he was last time.
Remember when <e>Obama</e> said 4 years ago that he was gonna cut <a>national debt</a> in half? That's funny because its almost doubled #idiot
<e>Romney</e> appeared  more truthful than <e>Obama</e>....

@ZachMarin34 <e>Obama</e> definitely learned from the first <a>debate</a>!

@Team<e>Romney</e> @Barack<e>Obama</e> <e>Romney</e> still invests in <a>Chinese companies</a>! How bout investing in AMERICA\, <e>Romney</e>? Also\, why are you on my feed?
Big problem for <e>Obama</e>: Last <a>debate</a> focuses on foreign policy. <e>Romney</e> will have a chance to hammer <e>Obama</e> on tonight's lie
Man I hope <e>Obama</e> win though..
People need to understand the <a>US Government's</a> process before they bash <e>Obama</e>. Things that haven't been achieved are not from lack of effort
<e>Obama</e> was terrific\, now for the win...
<e>Obama</e> may have gotten a little off\, but Mitt <e>Romney</e> barely answered any question he received.
@moonyzhang aren't you sided with <e>Obama</e> too ?
@edshow President <e>Obama</e> won. Willard kept going back to talking points & lies. Bet the righties didn't mind his interrupting.
<e>Obama</e> gets alot of <a>votes</a> for being mixed. Don't lie.
And did anybody else notice that <e>Obama</e> got to speak an extra time after <e>Romney</e> on like <a>5 different subjects</a>?
<e>Obama</e> came on strong tonite.  Showed he is commander in chief.
#LNYHBT  Tired of listening to <e>Obama</e> be a stranger to the truth. His failure to answer the questions asked and standard rhetoric.

i really wish i could<a> vote</a> for <e>Obama</e> :'(
I love how <e>Romney</e> supporters spin <e>Obama</e> as brash and rude tonight\, but when <e>Romney</e> was assertive in the 1st <a>debate</a>\, he was a hero. Grow up!
What can't be argued is that what <e>Obama</e> has done over the past four years hasn't worked. Plain and simple

@1rutwilldo yeah. <e>Obama</e>'s response to initial question was weak. The follow up question got a little weird.

What has <e>Obama</e> done in the last four years to improve America! Nothing! He lost the <a>debate</a>!!!

The reason <e>Obama</e> got elected in the first place is his <a>smooth speeches filled with simple vocabulary</a>.
 #TeamBarack <e>Obama</e>'s back!!! ... Fired Up\, Ready to Go
<e>Obama</e> has 20.9M followers and <e>Romney</e> has 1.4M. Hehe.
@LovelyLindsy <e>Obama</e> <a>lies</a> too. All politicians seem to be doing it nowadays.
Big donation for President <e>Obama</e> tonight
Favorite part of debate was when <e>Obama</e> tried to <a>answer the automatic weapons question</a> with his educational reform policy. #MakesSense #Not
 @koojababy not trying to be mean but Fox is a very very biased station which is very republican\, they HATE <e>Obama</e>.
If you can't see how <e>Obama</e> is screwing us over you need to open your eyes. I'm seriously worried about this country's future..
 <e>Romney</e> turened <e>Obama</e> into a angry Negro when they talked about foreign policy\, Romney explotied the Obama Admin  #StrippedNaked
 <e>Romney</e> has taken florida\, north carolina\, and another toss up but <e>Obama</e> still has a projected 294 electoral college points. With 270 needed.
@Trendystylists @sullydish nor the one I watched! <e>Obama</e> actually was called out about his <a>lies</a>.
Never thought I would say I want <e>Obama</e> to be president... But I do. <e>Mitt Romney</e> is an asshole stupid fuck who needs his dick cut off :]
@gretawire I think <e>Obama</e> showed himself to try to <a>bully voters</a>.
 If <e>Obama</e> gets re-elected\, imagine how much he will <a>blame the previous "administration"</a>.
FUCK FOX NEWSSS....m'fuckas on <e>Obama's</e> shit......smh
 Tonight\, <e>Romney</e> picked the wrong speech to slam <e>Obama</e> on\, and it cost him. He opened the door\, and Obama slammed it on him.
<a>Taxing</a> all millionaires at 90% would fund the government for 3 months. Great plan <e>Obama</e>. #debates
 Just so you all know\, I don't disagree with everything republicans believe. They have some great ideas. I just like <e>Obama</e> better than <e>Romney</e>
Barack <e>Obama</e> <a>plays basketball</a> therefore he has my vote.
All <a>lies</a> and <a>phony stock market bubbles</a> with <e>Obama</e> and his corrupt bankers. We have massive fraud with no justice. @cspanwj #tcot #cspj #p2
@JohnKingCNN @BarackObama @MittRomney Obama made his point with style and substance?<e>Obama</e> put<e> Romney</e> the bully in his place!
@RyanSeacrest <e>Obama</e> hands down!!
 <e>Obama</e> did much\, much better in this debate - <e>Romney</e> did average but not terrible.
 @BlGBlRD I see no reason to think <e>Obama</e> won.  Not that <e>Romney</e> blasted him away\, but seriously.  Also\, my psychiatrist says I'm doing great.
 <e>Obama</e> named winner by CBS\, CNN\, Google and PPP snap polls. I always view these polls. But they give hints like in first debate
 Yay. <e>Obama</e> said the same nothing\, <a>defending his terrible record</a> with more energy this time! #debate2012
@MikNastyy yeah and what a bad election that was!!Your right the debate is over good job and u still didn't learn anything!?<e>Obama</e> is <a>wrong</a>
World busy talking about <e>Romney and Obama</e>.
@Gregory_Danger you do realize that <e>Obama</e> straight up <a>lied</a> about Libya
 <e>Obama</e> signed <a>3 trade deals\, but rejected 18</a>...hmmmm. 37M 2008 food stamps\, 47M now\, 23M unemployed now. 7.8 unemployed 2008\, 7.8 now hmmm!
@kristalsanford <e>Obama</e> didnt get elected without a majority of white people voting for him.It would be impossible to win through the minority
<e>Obama</e> is a real nigga I hate this <e>romney</e> guy
 <e>Obama</e> saved the <a>auto industry</a> which has since added 100\,000 jobs.
 @David_Gergen I thought it was clear <a>Obama</a> win\, but I always respect your analysis. Keen and well balanced.
Anyone else find it interesting <e>Obama</e> wore a red tie and <e>Romney</e> wore a blue tie tonight? They represent the other parties color. #Debates
Sure <e>Romney</e> might not be the best but he sure as hell is better then <e>Obama</e>... #justsaying
 "@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a <a>liar</a>. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" Damn nt cool
<e>Obama</e> <a>speaks</a> with forked tongue #debate
 Do people not realize that <e>Romney</e> is not a Christian? He believes in God\, yes. But so does <e>Obama</e>.
 @CaptKrunch <e>Obama</e>'s <a>campaign</a> is toast. Lying for a liar\, nice.
Honestly I think <e>Romney</e> slammed <e>Obama</e> for the first hour. Until Candy started taking Obama's side. She backed up lie on terrorist attack.
All jokes aside- <e>Obama</e> was solid. Handled himself well
 According to #cnn\, <e>#Obama</e> wins this debate by 7 points
<a>The Rich Need To Pay Their Fair Share In Taxes</a>! Not Under <e>Romney</e> But Yes Under <e>Obama</e>!
<e>Obama</e> bought his A game tonight! <a>Women</a> you need to protect your right to choose. Stand up and VOTE.
 @IngrahamAngle Americans died\, and <e>Obama</e> <a>lied</a>.
 <e>#Obama</e> always seems so exasperated <a>talking about #energy</a>. "Seriously\, we have to think of the FUTUR... oh\, forget it. You're not listening."
 #PDSLive At the end big O brought up the 47%\, but what about <e>Obama's</e> administration blatantly ignoring half the country for 4 years?
@Bawlz_95 #Wrong <e>Obama</e> is a dumbass..
@___ADG so many people are in debt because his <e>Obama</e> care is forcing people to have <a>health insurance</a> . Even though they can't afford it
 <e>Obama</e> passed laws expanding opportunity for women. <e>Romney</e> opposes those laws\, but he has binders. Hella binders. #bindersfullofwomen
@NonaWA Seriously! <e>Obama</e> on <a>contraception and Planned Parenthood</a> was the best he was all night. Politically smart and morally right!
@HLNTV <e>Obama</e> won!!!!
I think <e>@MittRomney</e> will continue to rise in the polls despite the MSM's attempt to help <e>Obama</e>.
US Presidential Debate Round 2:The winner: <e>Mitt Romney</e>. He said <e>Obama</e> had the right plans but failed to implement - sign of weak leadership
I ALREADY voted for <e>Obama</e> ! #EarlyVote
 According to the post debate poll\, <e>Romney</e> beats <e>Obama</e> on economy\, taxes\, deficit & health care\, fair to say Crowly's stunt gave him debate?
<e>Obama</e> utterly lied for 2 weeks about <a>Benghazi</a> and then tonight YOUR PRESIDENT lied directly to every single american's face...LIVE
@CherylStrayed: <e>Obama</e> for the win! #OFA
 @gretawire Oh\, P Buchanan where was <e>Obama</e> right? or doing well? the man was bitter sour ignorant arrogant & a very small <a>performance</a>
Basically <e>Obama</e> is the man
<e>Obama</e> did a much better job this time than in last <a>debate</a>. He was engaged this time. It wasn't enough #debates
 <e>Obama</e> did very well\, but the msnbc folks are I think vastly overestimating the impact on the race.
@russllj <e>Obama</e> was really good this evening. I was smiling!
@megynkelly I was uncomfortable with <e>Obama's</e> <a>stand -up & interrupt routine</a>. It was a well-practiced rudeness that failed as strength.
 <e>Obama</e> constantly lies to the American people. He avoids <a>answering questions</a>. The choice is clear\, #RomneyRyan2012 @gretawire
@GinoGraul @2homeboys <e>Obama</e> creates no <a>jobs</a>.He's had almost 4yrs to do something & he hasn't.And the 1st 2 yrs he had a democrat congress!
 The debate was real\, <e>Obama</a> was pretty <a>feisty</a>.
Thank you Diane Sawyer for noticing the significant <a>time</a> <e>Obama</e> received more than <e>Romney</e>!!!
 I didn't like <e>Obama</e>\, but then I watched the presidential debate... and I still don't like Obama.
 I am not a huge fan of <e>Mitt Romney</e>\, but the choice is clear.  <e>Obama</e> is bad news for this country and a vote for him is a vote for socialism
Oh yes he can!!  Barack <e>Obama</e> that's my president!!
<e>Obama</e> is <a>aggressive and poised</a> he's not taking Romney's shit this time.
@gretawire <e>Romney</e> has a plan....<e>Obama</e> failed plan
 @CNN <a>For the mess that Bush left us</a>\, we couldn't have got a more hardworking POTUS than <e>Obama</e>. We are proud of him!
 <e>Obama</e> was the bad boyfriend who stayed out all night\,<a>made promises he never kept</a>. Don't run back to him-it's time to MOVE ON. #tcot #debate
If <e>Obama</e> wins the election I'm officially moving to Canada for the next four years. #GodHelpUs #RomneyandRyan
 @Thomlane @LessaT In the 1st debate\, it seemed <e>Obama</e> was aloof and disconnected. In this one\, <a>angry</a>. Probably more un-Presidential n this 1.
@TheWorldOfAphil we've all seen from the talks of <e>Obama's birth certificate</e> that even birthdays can be <a>controversial</a>.
 Wish I was at the debate. I woulda asked <e>Obama</e> how he allowed China\, Coke\, and Pepsi to drive up the <a>price of protein</a> by 35%. Dead serious
 Mitt Romney did an awesome job in the debate tonight. Took President <e>Obama</e> to task\, we can't afford another four years of this mess.
 @thebighoot @comfypaws "combat forces" not trainers/other designated forces\, exactly where Biden?<e>Obama</e> failed to keep our victories\,<a>win Iran</a>
I'm not voting for <e>Obama</e> but <e>Romney</e> doesn't thrill me either. America loses regardless. #debate
If we gave George bush a second term and he fucked us why can't we give president <e>Obama</e> another chance #Obama4president
<e>Obama</e> is gonna be speaking within 100 yards of where i sleep but i know my head wont get off this pillow to see it
 <e>Obama</e> won. He was smart\, clear\, compelling & decisive. <e>Romney</e> looked hot under the collar\, sweaty &'smirky.Obama was on point. #Debate2012"
 I would just like to say\, it doesn't matter where u r from the question is how he is going to make the country better. <e>#Obama</e>
 <e>#Obama</e> scores a 2nd round knockout over <e>#Romney</e>\,in front of his 1 st \,2 nd and 3rd born.  If he gets up again\, #uppercut him !
@_Anthonypadilla and <e>Obama</e> lost the debate
The debate was interesting but I am Team <e>Obama</e> all the was
 For the record\, my prediction is <e>Obama</e> will win\, but <e>Romney</e> will be really damn close.
Finished watching the entire debate. <e>Obama</e> won hands down.
@WheresMyLiberty that doesn't even make sense. I'm not supporting <e>Obama</e>. I'm supporting someone who actually has a shot at beating him.
I don't even have commentary for this debate because President <e>Obama</e> <a>executed and dominated</a>
I'm gonna laugh when <e>Obama</e> wins and the country will be in the worst state ever and I'm gonna just laugh in your retarded faces.
I'm pretty sure @GalindoJoshua was REALLY REALLY proud of <e>Romney</e> today! Pretty sure he made <e>Obama</e> look bad! #2ndDebat #Romney2012
 Election 2012: The Decision For Investors: <e>Obama Vs. Romney</e> on taxes\, dividends and investment gains.
A second term <e>#Obama</e> will <a>#ban #guns</a> a first term <e>#Romney</e> will not #banguns it's that simple.
@MKTWPolitics <e>Romney</e> looked more presidential. <e>Obama</e> looked desperate to deliver some jabs & never painted a cohesive vision for the future.
The BBC homepage photo of the Presidential Debate makes <e>Romney and Obama</e> look like a two man boyband.
 Dear Mr. <e>Obama</e>: "You sit on a throne of lies!" - Buddy the Elf
The <a>debate</a> was on point <e>#Obama</e>
@samval623 and not through social media. All I see is people bashing either <e>Romney or Obama</e>. If its a valid point to make then fine

Vote for <e>Obama</e> so I can continue having great sex without the fear of a baby
The nightmare known as the <e>Obama administration</e> is almost over. 20 days left to his defeat. :-)  #debate2012
<e>Obama</e> finally kicked some ass in this <a>debate</a>! #YeaaaaahBudddy
I wonder what would happen if we put <e>Romney and Obama</e> were one person. Boom! My friends would get along. This is why I stay out of politics.
 @DearThomazing Great! and after <e>Obama</e> DESTROYED <e>Romney</e> in tonight's debate\, they should have more fun 
 President <e>Obama</e> does not even know the <a>laws of the land</a>...what a fucking idiot....read the Arizona Law\, Mr. Lawyer before you talk about it
Why the heck was Romney even involved in #debate ?We need not forget that <e>Obama</e> has been there for 4 years and he has removed one Bin Laden
Wow - so <e>Obama</e> WAS wrong over <a>Benghazi</a> ...
Damn <e>Obama</e> you were doing good now you're slippin...
Just remembered <e>Obama</e> is on @TheDailyShow tomorrow night! Confetti and balloons! Woot!!
<e>@TeamRomney</e> great job on the debate. <e>Obama</e> was on the defensive all night. Hit him harder with the facts next time.
<e>Obama</e> totally won the debate today. No doubt.
<e>Obama</e> and <e>Romney</e>'s microphone technique makes them look like two open spot comics. Surely a clip microphone was available to them.
 On the clips\,President <e>Obama</e> & <e>Mitt Romney<e/> both answered questions about the equality of women in the workplace&national security. #PemiluAS
<e>Obama</e> is not perfect but he has compassion and empathy. That is more important than a fat pocket to me.
I think <e>Romney and Obama</e> should just fight
 I have never been biggest supporter of Mr <e>Obama</e>\, but <e>Mitt Romney</e> is just dumb.
Politics are irrelevent to me. I don't support either really but I have more respect for <e>Obama</e>.
Well <e>mitt romney</e> has 1million followers and <e>Obama</e> has 20million HA
 @peggychinn  I like that too\, go <e>Obama</e> :)
 @politicsmonkey I maintain that <e>Obama</e> will win. It will be close\, but comfortable enough due to the electoral college?
You know I'm almost glad I missed the <a>debate</a> tonight.  Can't stand the garbage that comes from <e>Obama</e>'s mouth.  Makes me sick.
Horrified at how badly <e>Obama</e> seems to be doing in the <a>debates</a>
<e>Obama</e> lost debate.
 @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @WillieGeist <e>Romney</e> was a bully to moderator\, President\, audience. Disrespectful to women.Congrats to President <e>Obama</e>!
<e>Barack Obama</e> the 44th president of the United States 2008-2016.
 I can't wait till <e>Obama</e> wins. I will seriously stand up in my history class and scream\, "HAHA FUCK YOU GREG LOGAN."
Crowley: America Took 10 Days Jan 20 2008 to Jan 30 2008 to Claim <e>Obama</e> was one big ass mistake  An Attack on America citizens
 <e>Obama & Romney</e> *both* crowing over how much extra wealth they'll produce from domestic oil\, coal & gas. Meanwhile the planet heats up. #wtf
#Obama #Romney  Lies spoken in an articulate manner are still lies. This is a <e>Obama's</e> way.  He stood on the debate stage and lied..Fire him
 @Talkmaster If Romney had to describe how different he is from W\, shouldn't <e>Obama</e> '12 have to show how he's different from the last 4 yrs?
@gretawire: Krauthammer was apparently had been drinking last night when he provided his analysis that <e>Obama</e> won the debate. <e>Romney </e>won!
 <e>Obama</e> is a criminal fraud\, a usurper. If you notice\, you are a "birther." It doesn't matter which crime you notice. #gop #tcot #p2 #dems
<e>Obama</e> had the better <a>tie</a> last night. #debate
Vote for <e>Obama</e> when you guys get the chance when the time comes around its a great choice
 New campaign add by Obama features Morgan Freeman on a voice over. Shit\, now how can you NOT vote for <e>Obama</e>? I mean its Morgan Freeman!
<e>Obama</e> would have beat the shit out of <e>Romney</e>
 Shake my Sheets! @andersoncooper Actually Admitted that " <e>#Obama</e> didn't <a>answer certain questions</a> in #Debate"
@YB_ChronDon yes.. <e>Obama</e> is a strong man..... ! Cause <e>Romney</e> is a fukn dick.
Vote <e>Obama</e>!!! The republicans won't help pay for school!!!! Vote Obama because he's the only one who gives a fuck!!!!
There's going to be #bindersfullofwomen voting for <e>Obama</e>
@AdhikariKshitiz nope didn't watch it but tomorrow I will get the chance 2 :) I heard that <e>#Obama</e> was #brilliant! #debate #TeamObama
 <e>Obama</e> won with "Walmart Moms\," sayeth a headline\, narrowly edging "Coors Light Dads" to win the Depressing Subdeomographic Title Contest.
Both <e>Romney and Obama</e> have really annoying speaking voices 
Love how <e>Obama</e> keeps pointing out how much of what <e>Romney</e> just said is untrue. #TeamBarack
The worlds gonna be one fucked up place if <e>Obama</e> takes presidency again #realtalk
 Based on what I heard <e>Obama</e> say last night\, if he gets re-elected\, I am tempted to give up-close my business and unemploy 230+ folks!
. <e>@mittromney</e> has a plan for #America's future. <e>@barackobama</e> offers #moreofsame failed policies. Nothing new from #Obama in #debate. #OH #PA
@realDonaldTrump <e>Obama</e> was more of a boistrous bull spouting out the same old things that he DIDN'T achieve in 4 years and can't in 4 more.
@PaulRyanVP Ask America why the press has never ask <e>Obama</e> the tough questions these last 4 years.
 <e>@MittRomney</e> great job by the way. Nobody expected <e>Obama</e> to even show up\, so that was apparently enough to get him a a passing grade
 @MeKaymi_Tensei He carried himself poorly in that <a>debate</a>\, but I do think the shitty moderator gave <e>Obama</e> an advantage he didn't need.
 @uhlyssaoliviero - if <e>Obama</e> gets elected\, guys like me will go out of business. People who pay the taxes that enable fin aid\, will be gone
I bet <e>Obama</e> was the kid in class who could smooth talk his teachers into postpone homework...but never actually turned it in
<e>Obama</e> has connections with Al queda terrorist organization.
<e>Obama and Romney</e> are lying they won't even answered each others question
 @sallykohn why don't you say that to the families face. You are a loser. By the way\, <e>Obama</e> lost the debate.
@AdrianneCurry Would just rather not vote for a Socialist (<e>Obama</e>)
 @fantaztika @TheRealRoseanne @rebabrooks @ConsiderThis1 I love Roseanne\, but taking <e>Obama's</e> votes is uncool as hell\, this is not a joke.
#music PROUD OF YOU MR. PRESIDENT <e>BARAK OBAMA</e> Watching second presidential debate is on #TeamObama
 @wrocorn CNN proves again they are in the tank for a man who consistently lies to America.  CNN is not news\, it's propaganda! <e>Obama</e> LIES!
 Here bit by bit the American people are standing up to Socialisim\,Communisim\,Marxist Muslims and <e>Obama</e> the Black Master of Black the people.
<e>Obama</e> has a holistic view of governing - sees how everything is interrelated and adds up to the economy. <e>Mitt</e>? He just sees biz men.
@rightwingertoo @townhallcom If if <e>Romney</e> hits <a>Obama</a> in the guts with this... Romney wins by a landslide
@BruceStJames Win or lose <e>Romney</e> had </e>Obama</e> on the ropes multiple times.
@FNCJrReporters <e>Romney</e> for the win. <e>Obama's</e> facts were skewed and he came off as rude. He didn't like Mitt calling him out on his lies.
Oh yeah. I love getting yelled about <e>Obama</e> at 9 in the morning #grandmaprobs
<a>#debate</a> <e>#Obama</e> did good last night but he is not doing good for our <a>country</a> at present.
 If you read today's news headlines\, you'd think <e>Obama and Romney</e> were in a UFC cage match instead of using mildly heated rhetoric.
@TheTimmyTebow  Try to find something good to say about somebody if u can but lv <e>Obama</e> alone. It's not flattering to u.
I don't appreciate how <e>Obama</e> <a>capitalisizes</a> on the fact that he's black.
 @BillPhill12 Omg\, that was the funniest thing ever - and every person struggling in <e>Obama's</e> <a>economy</a> wanted to say it\, too.
AllI can say about last night's debate is that <e>Obama</e> looked pretty desperate.
<e>Obama</e> called <e>Romney</e> an Azzhole!  #Funny
The amount of <e>Obama</e> <a>impressions</a> I hear is sickening.
 But honestly\, My opinion is neutral this year\, and that's why I'm not even voting. Both <e>Mitt and Obama</e> are f'n shit up. Why bother... #meh
 @MittRomney  <e>Romney</e> did awesome last night\,stayed on the defense&facts while <e>Obama</e> stumbled. Ohio for Romney!!
<e>Obama</e> scamed America the first time around. It won't happen again. #Vote <e>#MittRomney</e>
Shit that was a low blow to <e>Obama</e> omg lol
@bogealoge I don't have to I know what <e>Obama</e> <a>promised</a> hasn't come true
<e>Obama</e> is so cute
<e>Obama administration</e> can't get even the simple aid to <a>Syrian rebels right</a>.  It is going to the Assad govt.
<e>#Obama</e> 2012-2016
 I don't "hate" anyone... But I SERIOUSLY dislike <e>Obama</e>. The man irritates the hell out of me. <e>Romney</e> isn't much better. Reset button plz?! ???
@TheValorieClark i don't like either one. I am more socially conservative. But <e>Obama</e> hasn't done enough good in his <a>first four years</a>.
@electionate Women are voting for <e>Obama</e> because they realize that <e>Romney/Ryan</e> lead the #GOPWARONWOMEN  #VA women will deliver state to Obama
<e>Romney's</e> says No to ratchet.... <e>@BarackObama</e>  says yes!!!!! #47percent
I'm going to put an <e>#Obama & #Romney</e> sticker on my car to confuse people. The good news is that I don't particularly like either of them...
@MichelleObama  awesome we really need <e>Mr. Obama</e> to win!
It's amazing looking at my twitter and Facebook feeds and seeing how republican my friends are. I was a miracle <e>Obama</e> even got in office.
Someone had a sticker on they car that said defeat <e>Obama</e>. Everybody should get out they car to whoop they ass
@DatBiebsGrande your not even worth fighting for so goodbye have a  sucking <e>Obama</e> shit day(:
<e>Obama</e> gone win again
President <e>Obama</e> doesn't even answer a ligit <a>question about the Libya situation</a> ...or didn't want 2. Families of the deceased want answers.
I really don't like bringing politics on social networks but despite my confusion I think I might go with <e>Obama</e> ...
 I'm not a Democrat but <e>Romney</e> is stupid\, and <e>Obama</e> actually knows something.
 <e>@MittRomney</e>: You are very disrespectful to the American Institution. President <e>Obama</e> is the the commander and Chief\, You are a  bully!
ABC News:  <e>Obama</e> Mocks <e>Romney</e> Over &rsquo
.@SpoonerSpot Exactly. <e>Obama & Romney</e> are too well-rehearsed with stats that make voters' eyes glaze over. #debate
 @seanhannity Did you notice <e>Obama's</e> demeanor and voice when Romney smacked him about Libya\, he was pissed.
I'm more afraid of a <e>Romney</e> run America than an <e>Obama</e> run America. Romney has the potential to do more damage.
I didn't see what was so great about <e>Obama</e> 4 years ago and I still don't see it. I'm just another vote for <e>@TeamRomney</e>
How you know <e>Obama</e> gained back a lot of the ground he lost last night: <e>Romney</e> has spent the entire day pivoting toward women.
@MeenaGanesan I know President <e>Obama</e> won the debate. @EdithAbraham1 He whipped all lies and air out of <e>mitt</e>. @EdithAbraham1
<e>Obama</e> nailed it! #ObamaAtOU #fourmoreyears
<e>Obama</e> made the case for his 2nd term.  He showed the country his values and beliefs.
 @UnPoliticalPrty I had to block that guy\, if I wanted to hear to lies I'd listen to <e>Obama</e>.
@billmaher redue respect. U need 2 review debate again. <e>Obama</e> was trying 2 play by the rules. <e>Mitt</e> was doing the roll over & trying 2 punk.

<e>Obama</e> stated that we shall no more see warfare weapons on our streets. So please at least wrap them in a paper bag. #spinoza
<e>#Obama</e> probably gives out those little boxes of raisins on Halloween.
 I tried to find a binder of women for $20 or less on Ebay. After coming up short\, I decided to donate the $20 to <e>Obama's</e> campaign instead...
Who better to deceive the people than they own kind ... I really think <e>Obama</e> a puppet
@ABC Candy Crowley and <e>Obama</e> heckled <e>Romney</e> all through the debate. Very Sad..
 We caught <e>#Romney</e> leaving church\, caught <e>#Obama</e> a bar and drinking beer.. God gets you further then beer does! #TeamRomney
@dcwomenkicknass I never claimed to be a Romney supporter. I just don't support <e>Obama</e>.
 @IngrahamAngle u were great on @OreillyFactor\,\,<e>Obama</e> wasn't good\, he just set the bar really low the last time #Debates
<e>Obama</e> highlights how <e>Romney's</e> plans makes sure that investment overseas does not lead to tax revenues in the USA
I love this man! He is smoking tonight! <e>Romney</e> is gonna have a repeat of tail tucking!<e>Obama2012</e>
<e>Obama</e> is averaging 5.7 lies per minute of talking during this #debate
 <e>Romney</e> ended the night pleading\, <e>Obama</e> ended it declaring. Suffice to say it was a resounding victory on his front.
<e>Obama</e> had the best debate !
 <e>Obama</e> still hasn't told us when he's writingng his fair share tax check. Go ahead\, put ur $ where ur mouth is.
I love how <e>Obama</e> always has a big ass <a>smile</a> on his face
He jus said the magic number <e>Obama</e> won dis debate #47%
<e>Obama</e> won. Libya and that closing. The pension quip.
Man oh man I hope <e>Obama</e> wins. We're so screwed if not.
<e>Obama</e> did a great job
<e>Obama</e> won the debate
@ewilliam_ <e>Obama</e> record on what he promised and failed to do hurts him
Anyone who watched that debate and didn't come away admitting that <e>@BarackObama</e> cleared the floor with <e>Romney</e> is either lying or delusional.
One thing is clear?<e>Obama</e> legitimately does not like <e>Romney</e> as a person. He finds Mitt's success contemptible. #debates
 to bad if <e>Romney & Obama</e> had a twerk battle\, Romney would lose because he's white
<e>Romney</e> making <e>Obama</e> look like shit! #forrealtho
@KimPinkx3 <e>Obama</e> is a huge supporter of community college
 Idgaf if <e>Obama</e> is black\, that's NOT a reason why we are voting for him! He's just amazing all around
Clearly <e>Obama</e> won! #debate2012 #obama #democrats #leggo
president <e>Obama</e> is the first president to get teenagers and young adults involved in watching the debate and want to vote
<e>Obama</e> has a lot of support.
@Lil3jmg My parents think <e>Obama</e> is the worst thing to ever happy to the United States. So glad I don't share the views as they do.
 President <e>Obama</e> was focused\, detailed and strong on <a>Libya</a>. <e>Romney</e> was cought playing politics with the death of the US ambassador.
 Proud to be a registered voter right about now\, damn right I am voting for <e>Obama</e> again.......who mad?
@greggutfeld <e>Obama</e> had four more minutes of LIES!!! #debate
 BREAKING: Shortly after the debate\, <e>Obama and Moderator Candy</e> Crowley seen giving each other a high-five... #tcot #p2 #debate
I honestly don't want <e>Obama or Romney</e> to win.
 The crowd cheered for <e>Obama</e> when he said\, "play the transcripts".....He caught <e>Mitt</e> on every lie!! WE need Obama as President not a liar!!!!
 Don't expect me to defend <e>Obama's</e> policies & broken promises. Like I said\, blind political allegiance is funny. "@a_tweet_life @Al_Gorelioni
 I think <e>Obama</e> is secretly a terrorist. His <a>name</a> scares me. "Barack Obama" come on son'!
 Y'all see this shit --->"@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a liar. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012"
 @Dakota_bruhh in all honesty\, what has changed in your life to make you mad at <e>Obama</e>?
I say we have a hunger games politics style <e>Obama</e> vs <e>Romney</e> an throw Ron Paul and Herman Caine in there for kicks
Everyone Is Entitled To Their Own Opinions.. But I'm Proud To Say That I'm Voting For <e>Obama</e>. #thatisall
 I've seen 3 Presidents look at and lie to the American people. Nixon\, Clinton\, now <e>Obama</e>. Obama's lie involved the death of four people.
 This quote is for everyone who voted for <e>Obama</e> in 2008. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me." #Romney2012
President <e>Obama</e> lied to the American population tonight. Dug a whole new hole for him on this Lybia thing. #Debates
 I wonder if <e>Obama</e> or <e>Romney</e> ever went Pre-k? I mean they can share\, respect\, wait their turn\,or say anything nice #Debate2012
 Ed Gillespie: "For every <a>job</a> <e>Obama</e> admin created\, 6 people left the workforce".  #debates
 <e>Obama's</e> closing swing after <e>Mitt</e> teed up 47% comment was great\, but highpoint of #debate was seeing Mitt called out for being "offensive"
 "99% of <e>Obama's</e> policies didn't work. Just like the people that voted for him."
<e>Obama</e>-Thanks for <a>answering questions in the first minute of your turn</a> instead of walking around them..... #abcpolitics
<e>Obama</e> shut up your a liar. <e>Romney</e> shut up your a liar.
 You're Fired" ..@realDonaldTrump <e>Obama</e> better than last time\, but again\, <e>@MittRomney</e> wins. Good night. #debate
<e>Obama</e> set <e>Romney</e> straight tonight. Obama 2012 let's move forward
Polls say <e>Obama</e> 46% vs <e>Romney</e> 39%. #debates
<e>Obama</e> won this debate hands down.  <e>Romney</e> isn't sure what he stands for.
 Even in 2008\, <e>Obama</e> didnt statistically show he was a good enough candidate for Dew.
 @aegies @BarackObama If i had the money and wasn't so broke because of college\, i'd top that with $200. <e>Obama's</e> got my full support and vote
@itsKirenbitch <e>Obama</e> is classy as fuck. I wish I was American so I could vote for him.
I love how <e>Obama</e> <a>brought in the hiring of teachers into the AK47 question</a>. WTF? For the record hiring more gov doesn't grow the economy.
The economy tanked under Bush. <e>Romney</e> has the same policies as Bush.   <e>Obama</e> couldn't fix his shit. Isn't it time for a moderate president?
@profderien  thats to funny.. Did u kno that if dont vote for <e>mitt</e> I will go to hell bcuz <e>Obama</e> wants to kill babies. yes I was told this
 THIS WILL GET YO ASS BEAT"@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a liar.Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012"
@DavidLimbaugh <e>Obama</e> not as compelling a liar as Clinton was. Not to mention media monopoly is not the same.
@akinfolaju how do u do... Didn't watch it but using wat I have read so far it was a good nite for <e>Obama</e>
 @Lorup2 you're right not everyone is happy...but the key is who should be happy?<e>Obama</e>=middle class/poor\, <e>Romney</e>=rich 2%
 "I know people that have <a>healthcare</a> because of <e>Obama</e>." ... "I know people that have <a>jobs</a> because of Obama." (via @jferg & @benjaminkelley)
@TheLastWord @chucktodd <e>Obama</e> owes <e>Romney</e> nothing as Romney has never showed this President the respect he deserves.
 <e>Obama</e> totally ignored nor really <a>nswered questions on Benghazi or "Fast & Furious"</a>!  And MSM says he "won"? LOL
<e>Obama</e> wins the 2nd debate! (Once the conservative commentators go for the moderator you know their candidate lost)
First <e>Obama</e> knocked <e>Romney</e> the fuck out and then this twist on Sons of Anarchy #greattuesday
<e>Obama</e> went in tonight! that's my guy right there made <e>Romney</e> look like a straight fool
@Big_Vince84 @TiffiReese you should def just vote for <e>Obama</e> since <e>Romney</e> stank it up so bad tonight! K thanks <3
 <e>Obama</e> really skinned <e>Romney</e> tonight\, didn't he? Was a far better performance than the last for him.
<e>Obama</e> came today full swing like a hurricane level five at <e>Romney</e>. Way to go his excellency Barack Bama
<e>#Obama</e> is the truth.
@AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is.. But <e>Obama</e> sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING
 Given composition of poll\, fair to say <e>Obama</e> had solid win overall but <e>Romney</e> won on economy  & race likely to go down to wire #cnndebate
 @AshleyOkinawa lld I didn't say anything to harm their party\, <e>Romney</e> did that for himself.I just commented on <e>Obama</e>!
 <e>Mitt Romney</e> stripped <e>Obama</e>\,the orator was indeed a stammerer
 @gaylortangg and <e>Obama</e> has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx\, both of whom know nothing of successful nations.
<e>Obama</e> did not answer the question on Libya. <e>Romney</e> missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either!
 "@coledixon15: <e>Obama</e> is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries." @llcoollittle & this guy 2
@johnjferrie @BioAnnie1 Apparently not the independent women on TV in the focus groups who found <e>Rich Romney<e> more credible than <e>Obama</e>
 @RNCResearch Heck it wasn't the lies that are the problem\, it was the lack of <a>ideas</a> from <e>Obama</e>\, so another four years of the same.
The Republican goal is not to beat <e>Obama</e> down. It's to shake down and beat down the American people. Keep your heads up. Obama 2012.
 If I have to listen to one more <e>Obama</e> <a>speech</a>\, I think I will end up in a loony bin. What a grating voice.
If <e>Obama</e> wasn't running for president would you still be excited about politics?
 From assault rifles to education\, <e>Obama</e> you are OWNING this <a>debate</a>. Brilliant public speaker\, just fucking brilliant.
I am so pumped up right now. I cannot even sleep. #TeamObama - tonight we saw why we are going to do everything we can to reelect <e>#Obama</e>
 Bringing manufacturing back question: <e>Romney</e> - China is a cheat and a thief. #yellowperilObama - invest in advance manufacturing\, R&D\, tech
Will <e>@BarackObama</e> EVER correct <e>Romney</e>? The vast majority of that deficit is Bush's--particularly his 2 wars Obama finally put on the books!
i'm supporting <e>Obama</e> so much. I don't want <e>Mitt Romney</e> to be president. #NoWay
 Listen <e>Obama</e>\, Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league. Quit blaming other people for your problems.
 Finally just watched the debate on DVR.  Heated and what I have been waiting for\, <e>Obama</e> was on the defensive for most of it.
 First I was gonna vote <e>Obama</e> cuz of race\, then I was gonna vote <e>Romney</e> for moral reasons\, but after studying "1 Samuel 8"\, I want neither!
 I will admit\, #Bush's spending was out of control. But <e>Obama's</e> <a>spending habits</a>... just completely unacceptable #NotFittoGovern #Debate2012
 <e>Obama</e> you got Morgan Freeman to be spokesman on one of your commercials? Well since you got God to speak highly of you\, you will win.
 <e>Obama</e> did <a>lower taxes</a> on middle class. No Job\, No Money\, Lower Taxes #lnyhbt
@lindaph1 Hell <e>Obama</e> can't even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle <e>diplomatic security</e>? BHO Admin. is a chinese cluster.
Watching the replay of the debate on CNN.  Why don't <e>Obama and Romney</e> simply go MMA cage match to settle this shit???
<e>Barack Obama</e> wins the debate. Bristol Palin voted off Dancing With The Stars. It's a great night to be a liberal in America!
20 more days and this <e>Romney and Obama</e> shit will be over
@keithurbahn @speechboy71 <e>Obama</e> was a wuss to only bring it up when <e>Mitt</e> couldn't respond at the end.
@TheDarklady @benhowe well at least <e>Romney</e> didn't act like a PlannedParenthood Cheerleader! Please get a clue on how BAD of a Prez <e>Obama</e> is!
 I don't think either <e>Obama or Romney</e> is right for this country\, what we need is a ruthless dictator.
 You might vote <e>Obama</e>\, but you have to admit the <e>Republicans</e> built a pretty good robot.
 Election news\, CNN calls it for <e>Obama</e>. FOX News calls it for <e>Romney</e>. Adult Swim calls it a clear victory for Meatwad.
 Today's Presidential Debate ws OK. For me\, <e>#Obama</e> is a winner today by an Inch\, jst 1 inch. He shud b more Charged up in d nxt &last rd.
that dude <e>Romney</e> is full of shit. <e>Obama</e> kept it raw #Obama2012
<e>Obama</e> whooped both Romney and the moderator! Dayummmm #Obama2012
 Taliban shot #Malala for her ideal was #Obama\, All female fans of Brad Pitt\, Justin Bieber etc should be careful in Pakistan
Wondering how <e>polls</e> can say Obama won the debate but <e>Romney</e> won on issues.  It's hard to understand polling at times! #perception #debate
 <e>Romney</e> has shown leadership\, & is ready to be president! Will you see a bump in polls? Probably\, little bump for <e>Obama</e>! But hey>
<e>Obama's</e> <a>voice</a> is so assuring.
 djbuck@hardball\, <e>Obama</e> to presidential to bet <e>Mit</e> 10G on lybyia question\," just check tape" Mitts eyes big look like he swollowed canary
Heard <e>Obama</e> used Biden's acting coach - who evidently specializes in LYING & goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes!
 (1/2) Painting <e>Romney</e> as "extreme" social conservative more risky than "flip-flopper" but the payoff is bigger if <e>Obama</e> wins....
 @KevinMcGil Whoooooooooaaa\, Nellie! :-) RT FOX News poll has <e>Obama</e> winning tonight's #debate by 70%. @barackobama @davidaxelrod @joenbc
 @GOPrincess @interception225 6 of the <e>questions</e> were "anti" Romney\, only 3 were Obama
Oi why are Americans so ignorant? I think <e>Obama</e> is better than any other past president
 Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression\, basically <e>Obama</e> <a>walked</a> in like a pimp and ate that face.
Wait for the foreign policy debate.@stretch4444 I wish <e>Romney</e> had brought up the multitude of daily briefings missed by <e>Obama</e> !
I think it's now safe to say <e>Romney</e> is a stronger <a>debator</a> than <e>Obama</e> #presidentialdebate
<e>Obama's</e> going to expand the debt by 100 trillion dollars. Also God supports <e>Romney</e> Disprove both statements with evidence
 Watching the first Presidential debate between <e>Obama and Romney</e> on youtube\, these guys sound really intelligent.
Michelle <e>#Obama</e> broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about #Libya to save Barack's butt. #MSMBias
 @ItsEmaxSnitches Who will win\, <e>Obama or Romney</e>? click @VotetoWin_2012 and follow the link in her description!
@Boowaboowa Turns I got both right! <e>Obama</e> was good last night. But <e>Romney</e> is a poor candidate disliked by even sections of his own party.
The <e>#Obama</e> legacy:  Bad Policies = Poor Results = Gloomy Future. Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens?#Romney
Students have been camping out all night to see <e>Obama</e> and more students are beginning to line up!
I'm not racist but <e>Obama</e> needs to remember that a white man built this land. A black man sold his families to the white man.
 @AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power\, <e>Obama</e> should be your biggest enemy
<e>Mr. President</e> please stop the cover up. You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack. We have the transcript @Obama
@GMA who wrote this? Badly worded question. <e>Obama</e> won.
 Interesting\, too\, that President <e>Obama</e> called Mitty on his "Social Ideas"-- BECAUSE  SOCIAL = PEOPLE and NOT CORPORATIONS !
<e>Obama</e> calls out on Romney about his investment on companies (Bain Capital) outsourcing American jobs to China (Sensata plant in Illinois)...
 #debate Rose garden presidential statement (3:53 mark) <e>Obama</e> says "All Americans always.." clearly not talking specifically of <a>Benghazi</a>
 @keder False statemen. Obama had 14\, Mitt Romney had 2\, Crowley had 1. <e>Obama</e> wins on falsehoods #debate2012
@jay33231 just listening to <e>Obama</e> <a>talk</a> and blatantly <a>lie</a> is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again
White folks treasure being considered an honorary member of an oppressed people. A Republican coworker voted <e>Obama</e> to keep his hood card.
 Best thing about the debate? If <e>Obama</e> thinks he won the first\, he'll have a similarly distorted impression of the second.
 Yes\, <e>Barack Obama</e> LIED last night. On September 12 he was blaming a video\, not terrorism\, for Libya. LIED. #mapoli
EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since <e>Obama</e> was elected. THAT will get him fired!
If <e>Obama</e> wins this election because of women's issues...I lose faith in my gender. #prolife #smallgovernment #RomneyRyan12
Im not a Democrat ...I do have issues with the <e>Obama</e> administration ... but... the right is doing a great job of demonizing not criticizing
 Obama26Obama Let's hope WHEN <e>Obama</e> is overturned\, he ends up on welfare and food stamps. )
 Why is the media is claiming a win for <e>Obama</e>? Actually being awake this debate doesn't count. I like him even less\, he acted like a jerk.
<e>Obama</e> SHOULDN'T have to keep reassuring his base after last night. Please let him speak2&secure the independent& undecideds w/out criticism
 #debate If <e>Obama</e> had been telling the truth last night\, he might have won.  America loses when a President lies to our face! #RomneyRyan
 For a man with 4 years on the job\, pres <e>Obama</e> seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction.
Great debate for <e>Obama</e> last night I gotta say title of one of my newest song is what went down and that is (I Don't Run From Nobody)
@GayPatriot <e>Obama</e> is answering questions from US Weekly followers today. Let's overwhelm him with tough questions!
 Final proof <e>Obama</e> won the debate\, #FoxNews is "raising questions" about  Candy Crowley as moderator. #p2 #topprog #tcot
 truth-<e>Obama</e> failed on emigration reform\,but the republicans did to-they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted.
Why did <e>Romney</e> say unemployment rates have gone up since <e>Obama</e> took office? Wasn't there that study last week that said they'd gone down?
 According to him\, I'm what's wrong with society because I think comparing <e>Obama</e> to Hitler is disgusting and makes no sense.
<e>President Obama</e> is worth 12million and has money over in china
 .@AndrewRugg Predictably\, <e>the NYTimes and CNN</e> have declared <e>Obama</e> the winner and those are the MSM headlines.
So much jabbing of the other political party on social media. It will finally end in a few weeks when <e>Romney</e> concedes the race to <e>Obama</e>. :p
 I'm not saying <e>Mitt Romney</e> is the answer\, but I don't understand how we can give <e>Obama</e> a do over if hes going to do it the same way
 <e>Obama</e> lied about <a>Libya and production of coal</a>.  Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal. Not true\, People in WV are unemployed
 @whoisdemichael actually\, when <e>Obama</e> was a senator\, he proposed the bills & approved the plans that are responsible for our nation's debt.
@Daggy1 <e>Obama</e> didn't. Went straight into education. High end jobs. Prob there is. High end = low volume. We got that now in Ireland.
 @DETECTIVE4LIFE @davidwebbshow yes\, <e>#Obama</e> had rage in him\, felt bad for man in audience who asked question. Out of control n too defensive
Don't live in America so it doesn't concern me but I want to see <e>Obama</e> lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years
@SydneyREDtaylor I don't think either of them are talking about taking away financial aid but I do think <e>Obama</e> has helped with that a lot.
 They just said "Obama has really been pounding hard" on the news\, do they even listen to themselves when they talk? haha
 @realDonaldTrump With it 2 to 1\, & 3 min handicap\, <e>Romney</e> still won. <e>Obama</e> lied on economy & on Libya. Smirking like The Joker Biden.
If y'all think <e>Romney</e> did an effective and thorough job last nite I'm sorry ur fckn crazy PEOPLE we gotta give <e>@BarackObama</e> 4more years!!!
@Semkae I guess u didn't read the links I sent u. Even conservatives like Krauthammer and Laura Ingraham said <e>Obama</e> won @omarilyas @chiume
 From seeing the highlights of the debate\, I would really really really love to see <e>Romney and Obama</e> in a boxing ring
 @mckaycoppins exaggerates <e>Obama's</e> debate win\, but true <e>Mitt</e> wants to jail women who abort
<e>Obama</e> is gonna outsource low paying jobs (most of y'all) Create more High skilled jobs. (NONE of y'all)
<e>Obama</e> hits back in fiery debate: A more aggressive Barack Obama buries the memory of a poor first showing as he and challenger Mitt R...
 "<e>Obama</e> may not be the most competent president ive seen\, but <e>Romney</e> is a flip flopping lying piece of crap." D.Williams
<e>Obama's #failingagenda</e> is burying the middle class and hurting families! RT if you agree and read more from AFP Prez @TimPhillipsAFP!!
<e>Obama</e> cannot run on his record and 4 more years would be a repeat of 1st 4 years @DishFeed
That debate was heated as F#ck! <e>Obama's</e> finally taking no sh!t from this rat. <e>Romney</e> talks so much he's foaming at the mouth.
Just watching last nights debate. First question as usual <e>Romney</e> makes claims with no plan. <e>Obama</e> gives steps to success. #typical
All of the Obama supporters keep asking for specifics of Romney's plan. I'm just asking for Obama to present any bit of a plan.
 @brad4rdr  <e>Fox News</e> says Romney won. Given their record of accuracy\, we can be confident that Obama did.
@PoliticalTicker I can't see this.<e>Obama</e> performed better than last . <e>Romney</e> remained on top.  Obama was defending most of the time.
Yes <e>Obama</e> is DESTROYING the MYTH of White genetic & intellectual Superiority and? @jawbreakerctc01 @REM63489 @bootyisyou @BarackObama TKCAL
Well just found out <e>Obama</e> used to be a pot head #blowingupintheovaloffice
The only thing I understand about politics is that I hate <e>Obama</e> #nohope
 FTD is irking the hell outta me. Buy flowers ONCE\, and they parked their asses in my inbox like <e>Obama</e>.
@CNNPolitics <e>Romney</e> caught <e>Obama</e> in two times lying! That enough for me! #Romney2012
@nickbilton Agreed. I was surprised <e>Romney</e> got such a free pass on that in the first debate. I guess <e>Obama's</e> poor showing eclipsed it.
 "@WSJ: According to polls of undecided voters\, <e>Barack Obama</e> narrowly won last night's presidential #debate." A narrow win is still a win!
<e>President Obama's</e> <a>little trips to Virginia</a> are really cramping my flight plans.
@TheSlimmyMan @evalongoria How did <e>Obama</e> win! Please explain. He didn't answer a single question he was asked?
 @emilyctamkin You'll never see them post something like\, "Well Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama\, so LOOK AT WHAT <e>OBAMA'S</e> VOTING BASE REPRESENTS."
 Ultimate irony!!! @Chris_Moody <e>Obama</e> to crowd in Iowa: "I certainly don't think politicians should control the health care that you get."
<e>Obama</e> is losing the election based on his last 4 years of lack luster performance. He has a history now. VOTE #mitt2012 lets get jobs moving
 "I consider it a part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam." - Barack Obama
Enslaves people to the government just like what <e>Obama</e> wants to do in this country
I will soon. Just sat down for the 2016 <e>Obama's</e> America movie.
 Romney doesn't have a five point plan\, he has a one point plan - <e>Obama</e> ...That's right call his bullshit! 
<e>President Obama</e> is the sort of inspirational leader that I believe the US needs. Now he needs to stop talking about China. #ObamaWinsDebate
 #ObamaWinsDebate electoral college\, is what counts guys. And <e>Obama</e> is smashing <e>Romney</e>.
 @ChicGrl427 @RepubGrlProbs I don't think <e>Obama</e> won\, but I see your point.
 America doesn't need <e>Obama</e>\, they don't need <e>Romney</e>\, the need a viable third option.
 Biden on debate last night: <e>Obama</e> showed himself as "a man of principle\, a man of  gumption\, with a steady hand and a clear vision."
 <e>Romney's</e> history of hiring women from his binders is noteworthy\, <e>Obama's</e> history of hiring from welfare list not so much.  Your choice.
& Yessss <e>Obama</e> won last night debate :)
 Why most Israelis want Obama reelected? Because <e>Barack</e> wants more poor to become rich. <e>Romney</e>\, like BiBi\, wants the rich to become more rich
@americasvoice  are Latinos Libs fucking insane?It's <e>Obama</e> policies which have resulted in record deportations&S-Comm of millions Mexicanos!
Anyone see the irony on the left proclaiming this big debate victory when <e>Obama</e> lied to pretend he was practically a conservative? #teaparty
<e>Romney</e> has #bindersfullofWomen who want good jobs.... <e>Obama</e> doesn't.  You can vote for a job or an obamaphone. Your choice.
So happy I didn't watch last night's #debate. Can't stand even 30 seconds of Romney. Can't wait for Nov 7th to arrive. <e>#Obama2012</e>
 Everybody taking about i love Obama\,i love Romney and I'm like\,I LOVE WEED!!
I hope BravoTV hosts a Real Presidents Reunion series with Romney and Obama after the election #debate
<e>Obama</e> doing a wonderful job.
 <a>"Governor Romney you don't have a 5 point plan\, you have a 1 point plan"</a> <e>@BarackObama</e> that was a good one. #Debates
@JoeBiden <e>Obama</e> won the debate by a landslide
 @KeithMcCullough @daytrend  IF <e>Obama</e> won\, it was with the help of the moderator. I call that cheating.
@cavuto I'm a small business owner and think <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> are great. P.s stop reporting alleged attack as end the world!
 @zanzerjewel Who will win\, Obama or Romney? click the link in the profile of @VotetoWin_2012 to vote now
 @washingtonpost have you dummies still not realized\, as CNN has already said\, that mitt Romney did not misstep. <e>@BarackObama</e> lied again
 <e>#Crowley</e> aided Obama 2:1\, last word 8 of 11 times\, interrupts Romney 28 times/Obama 9\, more time for Obama and helped Obama on Libya. #bias
I'm voting for <e>Obama</e>. Even thought he did not fulfill all othe promises due to tough making decions he still helped us in some serious ways.
 <e>Obama</e> have Teenagers watching the "Presidential Debate " ! He's the first President to do that! That's what you call  making CHANGES !
And <e>Obama</e> is the savior who is going to bring world peace to the world.
@hardball James #Lipton to Chris #Matthews:America has a choice--does she want a president or a boss...and I mean a boss. <e>#Obama #Romney</e>
 @EvaLongoria @NathanFillion you got to be kidding... <e>Obama</e> lies-When his lips are moving.  Should be tried for treason\, impeached and jailed

 @JeffersonObama Well <e>Obama</e> is doomed bcz he will lose TX\, AL and MS :( lol
@gretawire People are realizing what a failure <e>Obama</e> has been.Hopefully more will smarten up!
 My aunty said she votin fa Mitt Romney \, caus <e>Obama</e> be smoking too much caus his lips blk... Lmmfao !
I find it very interesting that <e>Obama</e> criticizes Romney for having a large pension. I guess he thinks success is bad. That's the Obama way.
I don't like <e>Obama or Romney</e>. We're screwed either way. They both suck. Neither of them should be president.
Women care more about jobs!  <e>Romney</e> is our best choice there.  I'm tired of <e>Obama</e> exploiting women as if we need federal funding.  Women
 -is voting for <e>Romney</e>\, I'm against abortion and <e>Obamacare</e> makes it okay! #prolife #wtf
 When they were talking about immigration\, <e>Romney</e> called them "illegal." <e>Obama</e> called them "undocumented." It's the little things.
Key difference between <e>Romney & President Obama</e> is Romney talks about WHAT he's going to do while Obama talks about HOW he's going to do it.
 I guess everybody i follow is voting for <e>Obama</e>\,  cus everybody bad mouthing Romney lol
Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he's black.
@MiaFarrow <e>Obama</e> is killing the USA as a country. But at least he gives out free food to the lazy.
 @Trollpecki I thought this was Romney v Obama\, not Romney v Candy and Barry

Is it bad that one of the reasons that I like <e>Obama</e> (in a politically unbiased way) is that he wears nice <a>suits</a>? #shallow
 <e>Romney</e> great answer on foreign competition\, <e>Obama</e>-there you go again\, give me 4 more years & I'll do better next time\, trust me
@MiaFarrow <e>mitt</e> looks and sounds strong. <e>Obama</e> sounds desperate and deceitful.

 No doubt #Obama has gotten more time to talk. Yet if #Romney goes over by a few seconds\, the President gripes to #Candy. #Debate
 Some black people our age may or may not vote for Obama\, but MOST older black people out of school\, working\, or retired will vote for him.
 According to <e>Obama</e>\, Schools(gun free zones) are the answer to F&F. What a putz.  #2012debate
I keep asking myself...do the ppl really care what #Romney did with the money he earned and not what #Obama has done w/ our money??#debate
I'm at work. What did <e>Obama</e> do that made everyone lose their shit?
 The press room busted out laughing when <e>Obama<e> said <a>" my pension isnt as big as yours "</a> LOL \, Good comeback dawg !
@DivaStateOvMind I don't even care about all of this forreal....but <e>Obama</e> won this one! lol....Kilt that perfect hair Mitt! lol
Every American that I follow is obviously impressed that <e>Obama</e> is president.. -___-
<e>Obama</e>: Let me correct misconceptions about myself by spending the whole time attacking Mitt Romney. #debates
<e>Obama</e> says he believes in self reliance? What a joke! He believes in a nanny state!
#PresDebate There! Obama said it. The 47 percent. His closer.
 And Democrats finally breathe as Obama says "47 percent"
Notice how <e>Obama</e> didn't need to be told to stop.
Much better <e>Obama</e>
 <e>Obama</e> wins\, hands down! #current2012

@JenGranholm <e>Obama</e> cool as the ice in my freezer cnt wait until the War Room tomorrow!!
<e>Obama</e> killed it man. Good job on proving that factual error by your opponent. I'm proud. 
 <e>Obama</e> isn't perfect. But <e>Romney</e> is a racist\, judging\, homophobic douchebag.
 "And that's how you debate biatch" - <e>President Obama</e> as he looks at Romney and drops the mic and leaves the stage. #DNC2012 #GOP2012 #tcot
<e>Obama's</e> most important job is CINC. He failed in his mission with <a>Benghazi</a>. He lost. He should be fired. Everything else is window dressing.
<e>Obama</e> must have gotten really high <a>oral</a> marks in english when he was in highschool. Probably roasted the fuck out of everyone.
 <e>Obama</e> has done more in 4 years\, than <e>Bush</e> has in 8. Another Republican will just leave our country in god knows what condition #nbcpolitics
Classic <e>all the moderators</e> thus far have all been die hard liberals pulling for Obama and Mitt still wrecks him.
 Romney asking <e>Obama</e> if he has funds offshore\, Obama's face was like bitch I barely got funds inshore lol
@Ed @stevenportnoy @ABCNewsRadio I cant believe my ears!! What is wrong with people? They are so pro <e>Obama</e> they are def and blind
@GlennWalck i think it's cause i'm not FOR either of them lol although i'm leaning kinda towards <e>Romney</e> cause we've seen what <e>Obama</e> has done
<e>Romney</e> wants to look after himself and his millionaire mates <e>@BarackObama</e> is trying to help everybody by his FAIR tax policies
Wow! Great job <e>Obama</e>.What a comeback. Lol#PresidentialDebate

<e>Obama</e> won that debate guys.
<e>Obama</e> won that shit! #TeamObama
 I love how <e>Obama</e> threw out that he thinks his daughters should have the same opportunities as "anyone else's" sons....
Great debate performance by <e>President Obama</e>! Much improved from last time
<e>Obama</e> won that #debate hands down!!! Vote @barackobama!!!
@MonicaBrown FYI 47 percent are ecstatic about <e>President Obama's</e> performance tonight Mitt Romney. Our President is the truth!
@Foobian no matter who the fuck our president is and I think that if <e>Obama</e> stays in office that things will get better eventually...
 Everyone seems so close minded\, either <e>Obama</e> or no one and that's it and that makes you ignorant\, we need to know both sides
<e>Obama</e> - Same rudeness and arrogance that has been part and parcel of this presidency. Vote the bum out.
Very impressed with <e>#Obama</e> tonight. Much more engaged and prepared. No doubt about my vote #ObamaBiden2012
<e>@MittRomney</e> did amazing!! <e>Obama's</e> all about his broken promises and lied back to back. @MittRomney & @PaulRyanVP For president and vice!
 @zachbraff @donald_faison I just realized if you 2 had <e>a baby</e>\, he'd probably look like Obama in 50 years.
 When all I see is Romney this and Obama that on <e>my feeds</e>\, I'm doing something that truly matters. #breakingbad #season3
 #debates I dont think <e>Obama</e> has mastered the "aggressive" thing. He just sounded angry & stammered too much.  <e>Romney</e> kept his cool #TCOT

Well tonight <e>Obama</e> has something in common with the Yankee's. They're both losing.
 I'd say <e>Obama</e> won this #debate\, but it wasn't a knockout. Obama needs to defend his record better.
 Voting for <e>#Obama</e> im behind him a 1\,000\,000%
<e>Obama</e> always linked <a>Benghazi</a> to Cairo in order to link it with the video. He clearly did not call it a planned act or terrorism.
 I want <e>Obama</e> b/c I look forward to my daughter growing up & saying\, "Ugh. We don't have enough men on staff. Go get my binders full of men."
 @AceofSpadesHQ @jaycosttws @michellemalkin @noltenc "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation..."-<e>Pres. Obama</e>
<e>Candy Crowley</e> didn't do Obama any favors by lieing for him on Libya. Everybody and the world knows the truth

Race shouldn't have anything to do with why you don't like <e>obama</e> or <e>Romney</e>.
???@fivethirtyeight: Looks like <e>obama</e> named winner by CBS
Can't wait to vote #<e>Romney</e> #Get<e>obama</e>Out
 "Even Fox News is saying that <e>obama</e> won that <a>debate</a>! That is saying alot."
<e>obama</e> has revived spirit and his <a>policy position</a> are creditable!
I just read about 200 tweets and only 1 person thought <e>Romney</e> won. <e>obama</e> destroyed <e>Romney</e> tonight. #<a>debate</a> #msnbc2012
I feel that <e>obama</e> did better in the <a>debate</a> tonight
@michellemalkin I can not believe how <e>obama</e> can come up with one <a>lie</a> after another and say them like he actually believes what he is saying!
Well <e>obama</e> did a great <a>job</a>
People expect <e>obama</e> to change <a>America</a>
<e>obama</e> killed it tonight. Mitt..#sityoassdown #fourmoreyears!
 Did <e>obama</e> really say he believes in <a>self-reliance</a> and everyone doing their "<a>fair share</a>"...
@Joehahn_LP <e>Romney</e> and <e>obama</e> :).
Do we really need to ask CNN?RT@fivethirtyeight: Looks like <e>obama</e> named winner by CBS
<e>obama</e> is a <a>muslim</a>
@RyanSeacrest <e>obama</e> hands down.
Prez <e>obama</e> nailed the #<a>Debate</a>. #Team<e>obama</e>
Massive improvement Pres. <e>obama</e>. He out played <e>Romney</e>
I think Pres. <e>obama</e> did an excellent job tonite/knew he could/so proud of him @barack<e>obama</e>
This <a>debate</a> will help <e>obama</e> bridge the enthusiasm gap
@Barack<e>obama</e> I think your doing a great job in office and you deserve to be re-elected. <e>Romney</e> beats around the truth because he's sneaky
<e>obama</e> exposed <e>Romney</e> inconsistencies on women
#<e>obama</e> gave a whole UN <a>speech</a>
Don't like <e>Romney</e> or <e>obama</e> _???
<e>obama</e> takes aggressive approach in second #debate with <e>Romney</e>. http://t.co/VK5q68qc
@joerogan @RepRonPaul would have beat <e>obama</e> so bad in this <a>debate</a>
All these <a>commercials</a> trynna put <e>obama</e> down 
When @noey_sac pledges her support for <e>obama</e>
The entire <e>obama</e> family
Barack <e>obama</e> just sealed the deal. #4MoreYears
All I have to say is that <e>obama</e> has not created the <a>jobs</a> he promised
Way to go <e>obama</e>! If <e>Romney</e> wants to be a president he should start to respect the Actual One. No more sneering attitudes please.
<e>obama</e> won.end of story
Peace love <e>obama</e> #prezdebates
Loved how <e>obama</e> closed the <a>debate mentioning the 47 percent</a>
President <e>obama</e> was more effective than last <a>debate</a>. It is certainly going to help President in his standing with the American people.
<e>obama</e> needs to keep his loud mouth shut and let <a>Romney</a> talk!
Vote <e>obama</e>
Barack <e>obama</e> showed his black side tonight. #PresidentialDebate
<e>obama</e> you are a good man and with good intentions but your time if up as you have failed as an President <a>to get our country on track</a>.
Overall President <e>obama</e> has directly improved my <a>life as a single middle-class mother</a> in school... #teamnofoodstamps I do this on my own!
<e>obama</e> Won That <a>Debate</a>
#Team<e>obama</e> all the way thru ..he definitely dominated that <a>debate</a> tonite he slaughter <e>Romney</e> n put him in place like a smooth G @Barack<e>obama</e>
<e>obama</e> was accused
@DylanNoPants <e>romney</e> is pro guns so he wins the <a>duel</a>
<e>obama</e> & <e>Romney</e> are arguing about <a>oil</a>. First one to say
@JohnKingCNN No doubt - tonight's winner is President  <e>obama</e>
<e>obama</e> wins!  <e>Romney</e> is so out of touch with the middle class. #<a>debates</a>
@MitchellT21 Right. But you say <e>obama</e>'s views dont agree with <a>Christianity</a>
My take: <e>obama</e> won't defend his <a>record</a> and <e>Romney</e> won't tell the truth about his.
<e>obama</e> ended that <a>debate</a> with a bus driver uppercut #debate #cleveland
Looks like snap polls give slight victory to <e>obama</e> in <a>debate</a>. It's up to the spinners to win this one now.
<e>obama</e> & <a>Romney</a> face off #debate http://t.co/rG0iw18T
From what I saw #<e>obama</e> won that <a>debate</a>
<e>obama</e> saved the <a>auto industry</a>. Enough said! #Team<e>obama</e>
 If <e>obama</e> or <e>Romney</e> wanted to win so bad....they'd just make "something" legal. I would. :p
<e>obama</e> give me hope for life
<e>obama</e> won this <a>debate</a>....partly just for showing up this time.
Our <a>economy</a> has gone from bad to worse under President <e>obama</e>. We need new leadership and we need it now..
<e>obama</e> ended it with a metaphorical uppercut lmao
<e>obama</e> did great tonight! So thrilled! #that'smyPresident
Coolest stat of the night: <e>obama</e> <a>spoke</a> for a longer period of time
 <e>obama</e> wants us to move "Forward" from his "Change". #whyisitdifferentthistime #itsnot
More assertive <e>obama</e> argues with <e>Romney</e> over jobs
@Barack<e>obama</e> I just donated and would like to wish you luck Mr. President. We need another four years of <e>obama</e>!
I'm sure a lot of media will say <e>obama</e> won because of how poorly he did in the last debate. Even though Mitt was still very strong. #Romney
Just saw the presidential debate. <e>obama</e> was assertive and attentive. Good job.
President <e>obama</e> said tonight that he intends to reintroduce an <a>Assault Weapons Ban</a> in his next term..
 "You're doing great." #<e>obama</e> . . . You sure are. #forward #2013

<e>obama</e> is not in the wrong. in order to get the <a>economy</a> balanced
I think <e>obama</e>'s <a>lies</a> will come back on him. Give the American people a couple days to digest what just happened. Im pleased with the <a>debate</a>.
I will definitely side with <e>obama</e> after this <a>debate</a>.  Why? <e>obama</e> dosen't need a binder full of women lol. :D
<e>obama</e> can #suckit
Of course ???@piersmorgan: BREAKING: CNN poll says <e>obama</e> won 46%-39%. Like I said
I will make a bet that <e>obama</e> wins the election.. Any takers??
<e>obama</e> did work tonight

Sidenote: <e>Obama's</e> <a>profile</a> is sexy....Now back to the debate.
<e>Romney</e> is an <a>ignorant</a> mofo!!! #TeamObama
We're all children of the same God say ROmeny.  Except <e>Obama.</e>  He's the <a>devil</a>  #debates
I hope <e>Obama</e> <a>responds</a> with "i didn't say you didn't care about 100% of the ppl. You did."
So if government doesn't create <a>job</a> #mittswordsThen how is it <e>Obama's</e> fault there is no job growth
if we gave Bush 8 years to fuck our shit\, we give <e>Obama</e> 8 years to <a>fix</a> it. #TeamObama
Same God? <e>Obamacare?</e> Did <e>Romney</e> suddenly switch <e>sides?</e> <a>#debate</a>
OKAY when is Mitt <e>Romney</e> going to <a>tell</a> us what's HE'S going to do instead of what President Obama didn't do."
It seem like <e>Obama</e> never really have time to <a>make</a> his <a>point</a> but Romney do ??
Y'all see how <e>Obama</e> actually explained to us what he PLANS to do for corporate tax rates. Romney still hasnt told us any of his <a>plans</a> yet...
#nbcPolitics I looove how <e>Romney</e> is <a>trashing</a> Obama. #RomneyNation #Romney2012

Barack <e>Obama\,</e> Shawn Carter\, & Sean Combs have to be the <a>COOLEST</a> OLD' HEADS in the world! #TRUTH
<e>Obama</e> just <a>lying</a> now.
<e>Obama</e> can <a>come</a> to my house\, I'll dye his hair and feed him tons of food.
<e>Romney</e> is a genuinely <a>nice</a> guy. He has a great record in MASS. What does Obama have again? Oh\, right.
@ResCon1 Romney <a>said</a> <e>Obama</e> is responsible 4 the security failures that killed our pple in Libya\,Obama said nothing.#theblaze2012 #debates
@danielleverde lol <e>@BarackObama</e> <a><e>got</e></a> this in the bag! He was the president of debate at Harvard! This what he do! <e>Romney</e> is full of <e>lies!</e>
@applejacks_hunt @joeymask1 Race has nothing to do with it I actually favored <e>Obama</e> against McCain..but everything he said was <a>lies..</a>
<e>Obama</e> needs to shut up\, he made our <a>economy</a> shit
Aaaand <e>Romney</e> is still an <a>idiot.</a> #NoSpecifics #CantAnswerHow #Obama2012
<e>Obama</e> believes in risk takers being rewarded - except when the <a>reward</a> exceeds government mandated levels. #debates
My grandparents think <e>Obama</e> is the <a>antichrist</a>
<e>Obama</e> believes in <a>Free</a> <a>Enterprise\,</a> but "everybody should have a fair shot"
@Crystal_Wright That's right! In fact there are 900\,00 AA female entrepreneurs in the US now who <a>aren't</a> <a>dissatisfied</a> with President <e>Obama!</e>
<e>Obama</e> is now saying he is a republican. He is right that there needs to be more free market an less gov <a>control.</a> That's what republicans do
If <e>Obama</e> is re-elected\, I'm going to purchase my first <a>gun.</a>  End of story.  #RomneyRyan2012
<e>Obama:</e> I <a>believe</a> Gov Romney's a good man #debate #classy

Check <a>Mate</a> President <e>Obama!</e>
They both got good ideas but <e>obama</e> is the president we need to keep moving <a>forward</a> #Obama2012
#winning <e>Obama</e> mentioned the <a>47%!!</a> Wooooo! #debate
<a>47%</a> is finally brought up by <e>Obama.</e> #Boom
<e>Obama</e> sort of walked into that one. Romney said that all Obama does is attack him. Obama stands up and <a>attacks</a> him.
#debate "there are some <a>jobs</a> that won't come back". <e>Obama.</e> Get off your ass and make corp. <a>Taxes</a> competative\, and stop blocking anwar.
Once again <e>Obama</e> is not <a>answering</a> the question
LOL. <e>Obama</e> saved the best for the last. <a>47%.</a>
<a>47</a> PERCENT. <e>Obama</e> runs with it. At last. #PrezDebate2
DAYUMMM <e>Obama</e> <a>hit</a> Romney with that K-O punch at the end
<e>Obama</e> is going all <a>Biden</a> on Romney's ass.
I may be slightly biased as I really don't like the republican way of life - but I think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> the debate on substance #debates
<e>Obama</e> has done nothing for vets but <a>insult</a> them.
FINALLY! I knew he was saving it for the last! <e>Obama</e> mentions the <a>47%.</a> #PMTdebate
<e>#Obama's</e> literally putting me to <a>sleep</a> #townhalldebate
Proud of <e>Obama</e> for <a>reminding</a> everyone of what Romney has said. #sorrynotsorry
Oven <e>Mitt</e> is just <a>destroying</a> Obama #Bravo
But <e>Obama</e> gets final word on <a>47%</a> #fourmoreyears
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that !
The last 4 years didn't work out like <e>Obama</e> <a>promised\,</a> it's time to move on and give Mitt Romney the chance to fix these mistakes #addebate2
<e>Obama</e> <a>did</a> great!
The only way I would vote for <e>Obama</e> is if he <a>banded</a> soccer from The United States .
<e>Obama's</e> passionate last <a>answer</a> was worth watching this whole slugfest.  #OFA_VA #OFA #debate  Great job\, Mr. President!

<e>Obama</e> just <a>*Tebowed*</a> on his ass!!!!
@TeamSID http://t.co/sBmoHkZu not so sure about that. <e>Obama</e> is a 64.4 percent favorite in the <a>forecast</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> that one. Killed it.
<e>Obama</e> 4 more <a>years!!!</a>
<e>Obama</e> is just threw a verbal World Star Bus Driver Uppercut to end the <a>#debate</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>did</a> his thing tonight
<a>amazing</a> finish to that debate President <e>Obama\,</e> absolutely amazing
<e>Obama:</e> "I believe in <a>self-reliance."</a> Mr. President\, I'm sorry\, but I rely on God. He wakes me up and I live for Him. #HowItWorks
Way to close out <e>Obama.</e> Well <a>done.</a>
I have no doubt in my mind that <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate
I'm sorry but <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it. #Debate2012
<e>Obama</e> just went in for the kill with Romney's <a>47%</a> comments.#winning #debate
The debate was relatively even but <e>Obama</e> did quite <a>well..</a>
Once again\, <e>Obama</e> get 4 <a>more</a> <a>minutes</a>
Romney brings up the same points over and over again and tries to make them relevant. <e>Obama</e> brings up relevant points to <a>answer</a> questions.
OMG <e>Obama's</e> closing was insanely <a>great.</a> WWII grandpa and GI Bill? Slam dunk. #debate
<e>Obama</e> <a>beasted</a> tonight.

Debate was really a verbal boxing match.. <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> round 2!
Solid <a>47%</a> reference <e>Obama.</e> That really was a scumbag thing to say
Romney 40:50 and <e>Obama</e> 44:04. Wonder how many times Obama and Crowley <a>shouted</a> Mitt down.
<e>Obama\,</e> you better save that <a>47%</a> comment to close out your argument!!!
<e>Obama</e> <a>wins!</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it
President <e>Obama</e> <a>*clap</a> clap*

@KikiMonique_ Because the <e>hoodrats</e> don't <a>know</a> what or who a Romney and Obama are.
<a><e>Obama</e></a>
Yessss <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this
<e>Obama</e> <a>dropping</a> the mic would've have been hilarious!
<e>Obama</e> best do really <a>well</a> on the next one.
Fox going into meltdown\, <e>Obama</e> must've <a>won</a> #debates
Gon <a>head</a> President <e>Obama</e> lol :)
I hate political analyists sometimes\, because they be making <e>Obama</e> look <a>bad.</a>
President <e>Obama</e> signing autographs with that left hand. Yum!  So <a>attractive!</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>Body</a> <a>Language</a> again  - looking for his teleprompter and just rambling on
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it. #fourmoreyears
Yo wife is ugly Romney \, she don't have nothing on the <a>flawless</a> <e>Michelle</e> Obama
@FoCrealdoe <e>Obama</e> <a>grew</a> up in Hawaii.
<e>Obama</e> <a>won!!!</a> #thatisall
@Moniggyy <e>People</e> just like Obama cause he's <a>black!</a> #Racists #TeamRomney
#debates <e>Obama</e> <a>home</a> <a>run</a>
Anytime <e>Obama</e> talks about <a>believing</a> in America and Americans\, I just don't believe it.
#autograpgh <e>Obama</e> <a>signing</a> autograpghs like he is some rock star... give me a break.
@LatinosMatter: <e>#Obama</e> MOPS THE FLOOR with #Mitt Romney!!!! Yes he <a>did!</a>
<e>Obama</e> brought the <a>grit</a> tonight. I'm proud.
<e>Michelle</e> Obama is one tall <a>bitch!</a>
Very well played by <e>Obama</e> to save the <a>47%</a> comments for last....great <a>performance</a> tonight\, made me proud
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this! #handsdown
What an intense\, tension filled debate. Libya moment was deciding moment\, <e>Obama</e> <a>wins</a> this one. Obama came to play tonight. #obama2012
Bottom line\, <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years.
So <e>Obama</e> has a Morgan Freeman narrated <a>commercial.</a>  #itsover #hewins
These <e>people</e> don't care\, they just want <a>pictures</a> taken with Obama.
<e>Obama</e> is <a>doing</a> the best he can for the mess of a country he got handed! #Obama2012
<e>Romney</e> not even <a>letting</a> Obama talk
@CadenHaynes because <e>Obama</e> is a <a>beast.</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>Wins</a> by a landslide! :)
Exactly! RT"@CharlesMBlow: Obama saves "47%" for the last two minute so that <e>Romney</e> couldn't <a>respond.</a> #crafty #debate"
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate as soon at Romeny opened his mouth!
Is it just me or did <e>Obama's</e> <a>hair</a> get whiter during the debate?...lol
Of course Mr <e>Obama</e> waits to bring up <a>47%</a> at the end when @MittRomney can't explain! Wow worried #potus?
If <e>Obama</e> don't <a>win</a> this debate.......real Nigga shit......I'm gonna burn to house down.
What's funny is\, I think Mr. <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory.
I'm pretty sure any president that took over after Bush would've had the same <a>difficulties</a> as <e>Obama.</e> Give him another four tears to fix it
<e>Obama</e> verbally <a>hit</a> him with that uppercut.
It was <a>nice</a> of <e>Obama</e> to show up for the debate this time.
@Slate <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> Romney got blitzed. Though I am voting for Obama I thought Romney won the first.
Ig I'm the only one who <a>doesn't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama.</e>
Thanks for <a>showing</a> up this time <e>Obama\,</e> it's nice to have you back. #Obama2012 #forward
<e>Mitt</e> and <e>Obama</e> are gonna go home and continued this <a>debate</a> on Skype
Although <e>romney</e> didnt do as bad as <e>obama</e> in the 1st debate\, I see it as <a>1-1</a> Obama won this round\, next is boca raton.
#debates <e>Obama</e> really clear <a>winner</a>
My dad annoys me with how much he thinks <e>Obama</e> is like satan and <a>evil.</a> #chill #hesnotplottingtodestroytheuniverse
<e>@BarackObama</e> just <a>punch</a> Romney in the. diiicck!
@GaymerCon So <e>Obama</e> could <a>sweep</a> <a>in</a> and save the day.
Did anyone notice <e>Obama</e> and his wife <a>patting</a> each others back? Really?
Oops my husband just said <e>Obama</e> <a>mopped</a> the <a>floor</a> with this one!
& u look like a non muthaf*ckin factor RT @realDonaldTrump: <e>Obama</e> is looking rhetorical and <a>weak.</a> @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp
<e>YObama</e> so ratchet\, he was bouta <a>punch</a> dat Romney nigga in the throat least 8 times
@WSJ <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> and he won Big!!!
@CNBC2012 <e>Obama</e> may have won the battle but will he win the war?  4 more years of Obama is 4 more years of <a>Failure.</a>
@ZainMotani <e>Obama</e> can <a>free</a> Boosie with a pardon at the end of his presidency. #wipemedown
Mitt stuck his chin out and <e>Obama</e> <a>punched</a> it -Chris Matthews
I <a>hate</a> that the <e>reporters</e> reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama!
<e>Obama</e> <a>took</a> out the elite four with a metapod and no pokedex\, they wouldn't even let Romney through the front door.
What if <e>Obama</e> and <e>Biden</e> were able to tag <a>team</a> during the debate...
He stuck his chin out and <e>Obama</e> <a>punched</a> him hard. #Obama2012 #debate
#the <e>debate</e> is <a>boring</a> to watch after a while. I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm\, ughhhh\, and well actually... #anoying
Amazing that <e>Obama</e> would seek to dodge Benghazi and Romney would let him. In the end\, Obama said the <a>buck</a> stops with him. True statement...
is <e>Obama</e> trying to debate about guns? he doesn't know a thing about <a>guns</a> and that's #fact
@BenjaminWavey that sounded racist against my own race hahaha but I meant I'm <a>team</a> <e>Obama.</e> And yes!
@gretawire I felt bad for <e>Obama\,</e> he lost 2 <a>debates</a> .His record  looks bad.
HA RT @SwinCash: #Welp President <e>Obama</e> hit em with the <a>47</a> percent like the UpperCut heard around the world.. Then drops the mic... *Tears*
@Larrys_Bitch seeing as I'm canadian& don't know as much about america as you do\, all I have to say is my family would be <a>voting</a> for <e>Obama.</e>
@IChogan @Yo_Floyd <e>Obama</e> had more sense\, less God. Simple <a>fact.</a>
That <a>debate</a> was like <e>Obama</e> being the bus driver & Romney being that rude bitch.
@papchuseyo <e>Obama</e> <a>sucks...</a>
@BrettMineer: <e>Obama</e> needs to end on <a>47%!</a> Just for fun! #hofdebate #Romney #Obama he did and very well too.
Pres. <e>Obama</e> handled this <a>debate</a> much better than the first.
Smart move by <e>Obama</e> waiting for the last word to directly address <a>47%.</a>
(President) - Barack <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it tonight\, lets do our parts and keep him in office if you truly support him #Obama2012
Mane I'm in the process of trying to get <a>rich...everybody</a> PLEASE vote for <e>Obama</e> #SelfishTweet lol
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate easily.  As a woman Romney was so offensive.
Mamas dont let your babies <a>grow</a> up to be <e>Obama\,</e> let em pick guitars and drive them ol trucks cause cowboys have manners they don't interrupt
I don't think <e>Romney</e> was as terrible as Obama was in the first debate. But it sure felt like he got <a>whupped.</a>
this. RT @_FrenisWorld_: Ok <e>Obama</e> clearly <a>won.</a> Now go to Fox and they'll say Romney won and the moderator was wrong for interrupting Romney.
<e>Obama</e> clearly <a>won</a> that debate
<e>Obama</e> again <a>speaks</a> about four minutes longer than Romney.
<e>Obama</e> <a>shat</a> on Romney.
@CNBC2012 Moderator <e>Candy</e> Crowley is <a>biased!!!</a> You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak. She shouldnt be allowed to vote!!!!
Yes\, it's hard to change a country in 4 years. But <e>Obama</e> knew that when he promised he would do it... And he <a>didn't.</a>
I would say <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it in that one!Obama and Biden: 2Romney and Ryan: 1
<e>Obama</e> <a>Won</a> This Debate .
#hofdebate all the hard work and sacrifice of the Hofstra community and <e>Obama</e> didn't even have the <a>courtesy</a> of acknowledging where he was!
<e>Obama</e> got the trap niggas\, hood niggas\, twerkers\, hoes\, dope boys\, & weed smokers watching the <a>debate.</a> Name one president who has done that?
Wow <e>Michelle</e> Obama was just in Chapel Hill\, now she's at the <a>debate.</a> #SheFlyin
@GMA @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos - I hope y'all won't miss and/or dodge the fact that (a) <e>#Obama</e> <a>LIED</a> and (b) Candy ran interference.
@johncerisola The only reason teenagers like <e>Obama</e> is cause he's <a>black</a> and everyone thinks he's cool and like you just said a thug. Like no.
Stfu. RT @realDonaldTrump: Such long <a>rhetorical</a> and boring answers from <e>Obama.</e> No wonder nothing gets done.
@Evan_Sofa so is <e>Obama</e> but you don't see him <a>bragging</a> about it
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> !!!  Send Romny back home
when Obama can't answer a question\, he has the <e>moderator</e> <a>save</a> him by changing the subject.
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> itttt.
#debates <e>Obama</e> <a>knows</a> what is needed for this country. Romney is just gonna screw things up by putting his foot in his mouth!
<e>Obama</e> <a>delivered</a> a.bis driver uppercut. Boom!! #debate
<e>Obama</e> exceeded expectations\, a low bar set by the last debate\, yet he still <a>loses.</a> He's shared no vision for what he'd do w/ 4 more years.
Comparing <e>Obama</e> & Romney's <a>financial</a> aid policies - http://t.co/lS158tgk
<e>I</e> <a>unfollowed</a> her ass for saying team Obama. #thatshitstopstoday
Final minute <a>breakdown</a> for <e>debate:</e> Pres Obama at 43:57\, Romney at 40:58 minutes.
<e>Obama</e> is the definition of <a>#Clutch</a>
You fail to realize that <e>Obama</e> is not from the hood. In the <a>hood\,</a> your life will suck no matter who the president is.
I think the moment when <e>Obama</e> really showed he was <a>serious</a> was when the Libya subject came up. He took over with fire in his eyes
It's amazing how Romney criticizes <e>@BarackObama</e>  for what he didn't do but his <a>plans</a> will take 5-8 years to see real change. #NOT BACKWARDS!
Good <a>win</a> <e>Obama!!</e> Well won!! #Easy
<a>"Aggressiveness"</a> is not in <e>Obama's</e> character so it seemed misplaced #butthatsjustmethough
@DYANCASTILLEJO <e>Obama\,</e> I feel his <a>sincerity.</a>
<e>Obama</e> better give that black guy a hamburger\, so he will <a>vote</a> for him again
<e>Obama</e> once again <a>murdered</a> Romney in the Debate Tonight !! #Obama2012
Our viewing party room thinks <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate. How about you?
Approx Time period: Obama had 43:57. <e>Romney</e> had 40:48. Romney with the <a>win!</a>
Libya issue seemed to be one of the most significant parts of debate... Interesting how <e>Obama</e> <a>owned</a> up to incident after Hillary's comments
<e>Ron</e> <e>Paul</e> could <a>blow</a> both Obama and Romney out of the water in this debate. #nobandwagoner
I really just <a>don't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> was on point. Engaged and <a>strong.</a> Mitt seemed arrogant.
Wether some want to admit it or not\, some people just are going to vote for <e>Obama</e> just because he is <a>black.</a> SOME not all
@DevinSullivan21 <e>Obama</e> gon <a>beat</a> yo ass !
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate !!
Rt ha truth"@HURTJR: When <e>Obama</e> speak.. I <a>listen</a> carefully\, when Romney speak i check my twitter\, Facebook\, Instagram and scratch my ass"
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> http://t.co/AqChYUTK via @MarketWatch
@CallMeGrayy true\, but the <a>policies</a> <e>Obama</e> has in place haven't worked and he plans to continue them
@dannyajasso I don't know\, the <a>Libya</a> question and getting fact-checked from <e>Candy</e> was a big moment to me like Obama's tone 2 wks ago.
<e>Obama</e> should have dropped the mic after that final statement. He completely <a>owned</a> it !!
I kinda agree. <e>Obama</e> raised his <a>voice</a> but not the quality of his <a>argument.</a> Hmmm
@ericbolling Pres. <e>Obama</e> <a>called</a> it an "act of terror" in the 9/12 Rose Garden speech\, and then he <a>flew</a> to Las Vegas....
If <e>#Obama'</e> s goal in tonights <a>debate</a> was to stem the tide of Romney's momentum\, then he failed. #Obama 's <a>actions</a> speak more than his words.
Great moderation from Candy Crowley. Mitt seemed cranky and exasperated but President <e>Obama</e> was on point and intolerant of <a>bullshit.</a> #debate
Sheesh RT @ColbyMarkel: <e>Michelle</e> Obama should give <a>Colb</a> that mouth
<e>Obama:</e> "I'm the <a>president</a> and I'm always <a>responsible."</a> #debates via: @lauriesegallcnn
Fuck you if your not <a>voting</a> for <e>Obama!!</e>
Yeah. So i think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate.
Contentious\, but one is telling the truth and the other is <a>lying.</a> <e>Obama=liar.</e> Romney=truth.
I know y'all won't agree\, but I don't care because I love my <a>God.</a> I really think <e>Obama</e> isn't following Him at all and that's the main reason
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate hands down.
<e>Obama</e> ended with a knockout. The <a>47%</a> comment = the bus driver uppercut! Dont try to explain\, Mittens. Just get off the bus!! #POW! #fb
If to win this debate is to tell the most <a>lies\,</a> then <e>Obama</e> won. #townhalldebate

<e>Obama</e> <a>lost</a> the first won\, but he damn sure won this one\, especially with that last punch\, my manz was lookin like rookie!
Bottom line\, <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> have failed for 4 years &\, if reelected\, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years
Thank you\, President <e>Obama.</e> You <a>speak</a> for me.
<e>Obama</e> needs a <a>vacation.</a>
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate\, but not good enough. <e>Romney</e> held his own. Both had hits & misses\, but Romney <a>won.</a>

@BeirutToJupiter Yeah I saw that :) the content of what <e>Romney</e> was saying seemed more <a>prepared</a> than Obama. The Pres. prob. had a busier day.
Last political tweet: don't act like ONLY Obama tries to change the subject on questions asked\, Mitt does it too. <e>THEY</e> ALL <a>DO</a> IT. #fact

@ellencarmichael @mittromney Even more disturbing\, seemed like <e>Candy</e> set up every topic to leave last <a>word</a> to Obama
<e>#Obama</e> is desperate to keep his job as Vacationer In Chief. <a>Lies\,</a> lies\, lies. #RomneyRyan2012 #GOP2012 #Vote

<e>Romney</e> <a>wins.</a> No way Obama can win bc he can't promise anything bc he hasn't done anything in 4 years.
<e>Obama</e> for <a>president.</a> Case closed
@MyName_JohnJohn heck no! <e>I'm</e> <a>with</a> <a>Obama!</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>has</a> <a>more</a> <a>twitter</a> <a>followers</a> than Romney ;D ctfu !!
<e>Obama</e> Didn't Fix Our Falling <a>Economy</a> Because The Congress Was Very Republican So They Don't Follow What He Proposes .
On FOX News: <e>"Obama</e> hasn't delivered anything...he's been <a>bullsh*tting</a> on everything." Oops. Danger of live TV.
i feel like tonight during the debate i didn't learn anything about <e>Obama's</e> <a>plan</a> if he wins the election.... #awk
<e>Obama</e> should regain the lead from his <a>performance</a> tonight. Romney looked desperate.
In my opinIon <e>Obama</e> has already <a>won</a> . #sorrynotsorry .
@BarackObama <e>OBAMA</e> WINS!! Follow meeee please sir :) You'll <a>win!</a> #ForSure
<e>Obama</e> finished with a knock out talking about the <a>47%!!!!</a> #greatfinish #Debate2012
It's ignorant to not <a>vote</a> for Obama cause he's black\, but it's also just as ignorant for other <e>people</e> to vote for him JUST cause he's <a>black</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>took</a> <a>a</a> <a>shit</a> on Romney tonight lol
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> x17

I have never been more <a>proud</a> of President <e>Obama</e> than I am tonight. Long may he reign. #GOP #tcot #DEMS #p2
My opinion:  <e>First</e> debate goes to <a>Romney</a> <e>second</e> to <a>Obama.</a>  #nbcpolitics

<e>obama</e> will be <e>president</e> again because of <a>people</a> are ignorant. # thetruth

<e>obama</e> brought that fire to the Big Apple tonight #debate                           
So proud of #<e>president</e><e>obama</e> tonight. <e>Romney</e> and <e>obama</e> put on a great <a>debate</a> tonight. Congrats to both. Now my political tweets are over...

<e>obama</e> or <e>Romney</e>??                           
<e>president</e> <e>obama</e> kicked butt tonight on every topic. Good job Sir  I am very proud that you are my <e>president</e>.http://t.co/9XapZmOs                 
Why must everyone talk shit about <e>obama</e> tho? I feel really bad for him  i wouldn't wanna deal with that shit on a day to day basis. #lame            
I thought the <e>president</e> did a <a>wonderful job</a>!  He definitely has my vote! @Michelle <e>obama</e>                           
No saben quien gano el debate? Digamos q a <e>obama</e> le da para comprarse un footlong con Macadamia en Subway y a <e>Romney</e> le da para el de $2.                           
If you're seriously gonna throw my <a>pregnancy</a> into <e>obama</e>'s shitty stance in the debate tonight  wtf.how do they allow people like you to vote                 
<e>obama</e> killed that shit                           
I don't think <e>Romney</e> is going to win. the <a>gays</a> & <a>women</a> are going to dominate him. <e>obama</e> is so much better.                           
I'm not even stressed <e>obama</e> will #destroy <e>Romney</e> on <a>foreign policy</a> !                           
<e>obama</e> won that <a>debate</a> hands down. Disagree tweet me why                           
 ???@MixedGirlBarbie give a bitch a chance!  <e>obama</e>'s motto is "CHANGE" mine would be "Errthang Free"???                           
#EUA #tiosam <e>obama</e> desafia <e>Romney</e> em segundo debate eleitoral nos EUA - Terra Brasil http://t.co/W8gE2hSD - http://t.co/gmkmBSU1                           
 Barrack <e>obama</e> should practice what he <a>preaches</a> in "we can make a change" #Mitt<e>Romney</e>For<e>president</e> there's a reason for a <a>debt</a>..                           
for all the people that complained about <e>obama</e> being interrupted  he talked for 44 minutes and <e>Romney</e> talked for only 40 minutes              
Critized As A Nation . <e>obama</e> Ain't Bein' Replaced . #Team<e>obama</e> .                           
I wouldnt vote for a <e>president</e> who really just wants to be an actor in <a>movies</a>  #<e>obama</e> its not a joke. #PrayingforAmerica #OneNationUnderGod!                   
So <e>Romney</e> absolutely destroyed <e>obama</e> again tonight. This shit is becoming almost humorous! Still a straight Ron Paul supporter though.                           
<e>obama</e> keeps bringing up <e>Romney</e>'s 47% quote & media wont talk abt him abandoning the <a> white working class vote</a>   http://t.co/imMTMnKh #debate                           
<e>obama</e> when Uwere on the phone <a>w/Libya after attacks</a> was it on a free GovtWelfare phone? w/static on the line Uheard video instead of terror                           
@reeseycup_72 I love how <e>obama</e> said he dosen't think that government creates <a>jobs </a>yet everything he does suggests that is what he believes.                           
But why is Mitt <e>Romney</e> violating <e>obama</e> #hardbody on twitter lmfaoooo look at his tweets #tko                           
??<e>obama</e> vs <e>Romney</e>? pfff  un poroto... http://t.co/9nBYMNea                       
@SethVilleda Hahahahaha yeah right !!! He's Seriously Gonna <a>Destroy This Country</a> With His White Racist Ass I Swear! I'm Sure <e>obama</e> Got This                           
@kcjenkins1 Sure <e>obama</e> dodged it but <e>Romney</e> didn't. I don't see how Charles then give <e>obama</e> the <a>debate</a> on points. Next debate is FP. Libya
